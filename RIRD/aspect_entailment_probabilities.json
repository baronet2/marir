The servers are all wearing fancy suits, and there's even a wall with a ton of wine bottles. It's not fancy like a steakhouse, but it looks nice, rather than faux-fancy.

They were all a lot of fun to watch.Once we got to our table, we were presented with a challenge: navigating the menu. There are TWO menus, each containing well over 100 items, and many of them don't have clear prices. On top of that, some of the items were only in Chinese. If you're not Chinese yourself, figuring out what to order can be quite complicated. We asked for advice from our server, but that didn't help us narrow down - it just left us with even more options. It seemed like some of the dishes were more authentic, whereas others were more \"tourist-friendly.\" We ended up getting the \"dinner for 4\" (the one with BBQ pork, since there are two different \"dinners for 4\" - one per menu), plus some fresh scallops.The dinner came with multiple different dishes which we shared family-style. Some of them were great, such as the soup, the BBQ pork (which was the highlight), and the stir-fried shrimp. Some were just ok, such as the scallops and the fish. Others were disappointing, such as the bok choy and the dessert. I think there's a bit of a learning curve - you need to figure out what's good (and what you like) in order to maximize your enjoyment.Overall, the meal was certainly unique, and on the whole we had a good time.

Came here with a party of three... Although my expectations were high coming into the restaurant, the food still well exceeded my standards. I was completely blown away! We reserved our table well in advance (a month ago), so this was a long awaited meal.The waitress told us that the style of Byblos is sharing plates, and that roughly 6 plates would be needed to serve the three of us. Naively, we told her that since we had small appetites, we shouldn't need six plates. Little did we know... The food was so addicting, and the portions were fairly small, leading us to order round after round after round.We started off with a couple appetizers, outlined below.Turkish Manti Dumplings:I've heard so many different things about this dish - some people love it, others find it too bland. We loved it! The flavours were super complex; although being completely vegetarian, it didn't taste it at all. The eggplant had a rich smokey flavour that accentuated the dish. The creamy halloumi and tangy yogurt balanced the salty flavour of the eggplant. I didn't really taste the sweetness of the molasses, and really enjoyed the crisp dumpling surface contrasted with the creamy sauce. Fig Salad:The first and foremost flavour that jumps out at you when eating this salad is the floral taste, stemming from the orange blossom vinaigrette. The tangy vinegar had a very delicate blossom undertone; I could truly taste the fragrance and perfume of the orange blossom. The figs added a nice touch of sweetness; however, there were very little pieces. When we brought that up to the waitress, she was kind enough to accommodate and brought us a dish of a fresh fig cut up. The fig was delightfully fresh! I liked this salad - however, given its high price point, it was a small portion with few ingredients.For the mains, we had a variety of different dishes such as the following.Tah-Dig:This is a classic Mediterranean dish with crispy rice, and surprisingly small for its ingredients and price (I think I'm seeing a trend). That said, the rice was addicting crispy and delicious! The lamb was braised to be fall apart tender, and the warm figs highlighted and lightened the meal. The nuts were a nice addition. Grilled Whole Banzino:This was by far my favourite dish of the entire meal! It was my first time having chermoullah, a pesto-like savoury salty sauce. The parsley and cilantro green dressing with the lemon juice really lightened up the grilled fish. The skin was also the right amount of crisp. I was amazed by this dish, and ate every single last piece.Ora King Salmon:We didn't have enough, and so ordered this additional protein. The four pieces of salmon were grilled to a perfect char, rendering the skin crispy. Meanwhile, the salmon was cooked just right - the inside was moist and tender. It was the perfect pink, and by no means dry. The harissa sauce was a lovely spicy addition. Though good, it didn't stand up to the banzino for me.Crispy Hand Rolled Couscous:This dish was very similar to the Tah-Dig in that it was likewise crispy. That said, I enjoyed this dish so much more! The creamy halloumi with the collard greens was absolutely delicious. I'm not a fan of cheese, but this and the Manti Dumplings really won me over.We ended the meal with a dessert. We couldn't decide between the baklava and pavlova (both executed in fusion style), but the waitress recommended the baklava.Stuffed Baklava:This dish had mint ice cream stuffed inside crispy pastry (similar to a cannoli), sprinkled with pistachios and topped with a dark chocolate mousse. It was an interesting mix and juxtaposition of flavours and textures - the crisp of the pastry and pistachio contrasted with the creamy mousse/chocolate and ice cream. The sweetness of the dark chocolate and ice cream was cut by the sudden addition of sea salt. To be honest, this dessert wasn't my favourite as the salt caught me off guard.

Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen - Best. Ramen. Ever. If you love smokiness in everything (in food, cocktails, weed LMAO just kidding), you will love this one. Highly recommend. #\u4e00\u8a66\u96e3\u5fd82. Vegetarian Ramen with Creamy Potato Soy Milk Broth - Hella yass. This one is so creamy good; I wanted to drink all the broth lol. Though it is vegetarian, I added braised pork belly (+$3) for my meat-lover self lol.3. Signature Clam Broth Ramen (Shio) - Definitely a classic at Konjiki.

It seems like they only have it on Wednesdays! Gotta make time for thissss... till next time :)P.S.

The Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen was overpowering in flavour. When I eat ramen, I make sure to finish my broth. This, however, wasn't one of those instances. The intensity of the flavour came from the fat content in the broth & the amount of salt.The smokiness only came through in the cherry tomatoes (surprisingly). The Clam Broth Ramen was good, but I had the opposite issue with the broth--it was underwhelming. There simply wasn't enough seafood flavour. The portions are also fairly small for the price.

Parking was a bit of a struggle, when we went the front parking was all full as was the parking on the side (also, alot of the parking is reserved for their neighbouring units). Not sure if they changed the ordering system or what, but we were a bit confused during our visit. Instead of ordering at the front like the others mentioned, the server was walking around taking orders and left the front unmanned. Whateva no matter really, just seemed a bit pointless to have him walking around taking orders. We just shared an Eggs Benedict w Smoked Salmon, Portabello shrooms, & Kale. This came with fried mini potatoes and a small, light salad. The potatoes and salad were fresh. But the eggs benny thooooooo... :( . My first qualm was with the English muffin it was on, it ain't toasted which makes it quite difficult to slice with the provided butter knife. Second complaint, that raw kale. I don't get it...why RAW? Imo, lightly sauteed kale with some seasoning would've made this dish much better. Kale doesn't really give you that crunch factor if that was the reasoning for adding it (nor does it really add any flavour). Also , the amount of portabello mushrooms were weak today. Also ordered a flat white, which was good. And a matcha affogato which is essentially matcha + vanilla ice cream, it was good as well. The service here is good - the servers were very nice. But the food came out at a snail's pace which I don't understand why since literally the only thing that needs to be cooked to order is poached eggs.

This restaurant is simply AMAZING. From the moment I entered, we were treated with incredible service. We arrived 30 minutes early for our reservation, and the manager personally took our drink order to enjoy while we waited for our table. The dim lights and ambience of the place made it easy to relax and enjoy dinner. Its a large plate sharing type of restaurant where a different server brings out each dish and describes it to you. We ordered multiple dishes and they even switched our plates and utensils between each order so as not to mix the flavors! The hostess was pleasant, and service was nothing short of what I would expect at this type of place. 5 stars from me! We ordered a total of 4 dishes to split between 2 people, which was a good amount because we were so hungry! If you're not really hungry, then 2-3 dishes shared between 2 people would be ideal. We of course ordered the 19 ingredient signature Singapore slaw, they bring it out in a huge tray and toss it in front of you - the server even let me take a picture of the salad before he tossed it haha! The salad itself was incredibly satisfying, the dressing was perfectly seasoned and the salad itself was light and refreshing which is surprising for 19 ingredients! We also ordered the goat cheese tarte which was delicious! The third dish was shrimp and lobster ravioli, 8 could honestly eat this ALL DAY LONG! The shrimp itself with the garlic sauce was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. As a shrimp enthusiast, I make sure to always order the shrimp dishes, and this did not disappoint. It was definitely one of the best shrimp dishes I've ever had. Lastly, we ordered the Top Chef Curry Chicken dish which is the winner of top chef. I honestly don't think I've ever had such perfectly cooked chicken, with a crispy thin skin. The chef recommends that you eat each bite of chicken with a piece of grilled pineapple and try the different sauces - mint with a spicy sauce and a coconut curry sauce. Honestly words cannot describe how delectable this dish was, I could eat this every single day of my life and not be bored!Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant and it's experience to EVERYONE, at least once. The one thing I have to add is that it is quite expensive, around $20-$40 per each entr\u00e9e, so if you're on a budget I recommend trying 1-2 dishes and to make reservations for a special occasion! If not the dishes we ordered, there is definitely something on the menu for everyone!! This place gets 5 Stars from me.

The guy putting on the cheese only added a little more when I said extra though and it was a little awkward to ask him more.

We had tickets to the Royal Alexandra Theatre and thought that this would be the perfect time for a second attempt. As we passed by at 5:25pm, we noticed the line up already out the door. I ended up jumping out of the car while hubby went to look for parking.

We also got two iced teas. When I asked if they came pre-sweetened, I should've asked if the level of sweetness could be customized since other places typically make it too sweet for my liking.

The white sesame shio ramen comes with sesame seeds you can grind up to add some extra flavour. It's a bit of manual work, but the experience is what makes it worth it. The bowl itself is so much different from all their other bowls in how rich and creamy it is, and it's perfectly complemented by the sweet and savory taste of the takoyaki.Ramen Isshin is very popular though, so arrive a bit early if you want to be seated immediately.

It delivers on the unique qualities of a great ramen \u00a0- rich, flavourful broth, succulent noodles, the right combination of garlic/salt/spice - but then elevates the whole experience with an inventiveness only a great and passionate chef could muster. I got the Red Dragon. Besides ticking all the box's I just mentioned, it also had this mild sweetness to it. I generally don't like much sweetness in a savoury dish, but this somehow pulled everything together really nicely, almost as thought the ingredients were naturally sweet. I doubt no sugar was added, but the point is that it worked. Really, really well. The pork itself was lovely. I'm not a big pork guy, but the flavour of the meat wasn't at all aggressive which I appreciated. The sprouts added an awesome crunch, along with the peanuts. Loved the chilli flake oil on top as well. The dish itself was also really beautifully presented. I wasn't starving going in, but got hungry the moment I was served. Finally, it's worth pointing out that the Red Dragon isn't exactly cheap - it came to just over $20 after tax and tip, so high for ramen.

It also seems like Cactus Club is composed of 3 different restaurants - each being on a different floor!Atmosphere?I absolutely was blown away by the interior of the rooftop. It is so so beautiful and such a fun environment. The music wasn't too loud either. There were fun couch seats around the edge, but we did not get seated there (I think those are for bigger groups). There are sheer, white curtains that I believe you can close if you wanted more privacy... it made the place look more like a resort and added a poise vibe.Service/Staff?It seemed as if all the servers were women. They weren't the friendliest but everything was brought to us in a timely manner so I have no real complaints. Food/Menu?The menu is a simple two pager which I like because when there are too many options then it gets really confusing for me to choose. For drinks- we started with the \"rose sangria\" and a \"signature sangria\". They both had sprite in them which made them fizzy and the flavours were AMAZING! We said they both tasted similar to slushies but the signature sangria was much better so get the one for sure!!!I have tried SO many sangrias in my life and that one in particular was very high up there. For mains - she recommended the chicken creole and the poke bowl so we each got that. The poke bowl was very fresh with the mangoes and salmon, and the chicken creole with asparagus/mashed potatoes was really tasty and simple. It was the perfect portion. Overall we loved loved loved this place and would totally go back!Would be so much for a night out for a friends birthday or even for a nice lunch.", "labels": ["fancy", "Pakistani restaurant", "bubble tea", "cafe", "Japanese restaurant", "Italian place", "beer", "ice cream shop", "burger", "pasta"], "scores": [0.9769150018692017, 0.4071386754512787, 0.16652517020702362, 0.15462400019168854, 0.14054462313652039, 0.12956686317920685, 0.07587342709302902, 0.05074479430913925, 0.04227069020271301, 0.04182159900665283]}, {"sequence": "Portions are super generous.

We started off with some green tea, which was nicely packaged in mason jars (so hipster) - careful though, as they cost extra!We then ordered an appetizer of tako wasabi to share. This was my first time trying, and I loved it! It was delicious. We also got a side of takoyaki, which was decent. It definitely was quite soggy and the flavour fell flat. Nothing like what you'd get in Osaka, but I obviously can't compare Canadian standards to authentic Japanese cuisine!I ordered the original pork ramen, as I've heard it's what Kinton is famous for. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed by the end result! The chashu, unlike what it should be, was literally pure fat. Although that may appeal to some people, I didn't find it to be the best companion to the meal. The broth was bone white, but for some reason, I found that it really did lack depth of flavour. It was fatty, for sure, but I've made ramen broth at home, and I really do think it was missing that collagen. I've had better broth at smaller ramen joints, and perhaps Kinton is just too large a franchise/business to really put as much effort into its broth anymore.Overall, it was okay, but would likely not return just for its ramen.", "labels": ["fancy", "Japanese restaurant", "cafe", "bubble tea", "pasta", "beer", "Italian place", "ice cream shop", "burger", "Pakistani restaurant"], "scores": [0.9803725481033325, 0.9726609587669373, 0.6445853114128113, 0.3108493387699127, 0.13515117764472961, 0.0999050885438919, 0.08139240741729736, 0.06103317812085152, 0.04519771412014961, 0.027638815343379974]}, {"sequence": "After a crazy week of midterms, assignments, project and presentation, I finally felt a little more relax today. \u00a0 And it is such a wet and rainy day with gloomy weather. \u00a0I love the umami taste of miso with ramen, so good and so satsifying, but Kinto really fall short of my expectations.It was kind of condescending when I asked the server whether i can change my meal to a combo with gyoza and ramen noodle.\u00a0 He was border line rude with his fool attitude.\u00a0 I thought the servers in Japanese restaurants are usually really polite, but definitely not this one.\u00a0 The long bench table was made out of cement with a protective layer on top which I thought was kind of interesting.\u00a0 The seat I was on was really uncomfortable since the height was a little bit too high.\u00a0 I guess this is to save space and there was a little compartment underneath the chair so you can pick your personal belongings.\u00a0 It was functional but uncomfortable.The servers were not really responsive, but I think it might also be due to the setup of the restaurant which may not allow a nice view of the entire restaurant from every angle.\u00a0 The miso ramen noodle was really tasty.\u00a0 You can really taste the ramen noodles were freshly made.\u00a0 The thin ramen noodle complement the rich soup base with charred bbq pork nicely slice and plate on top of the ramen, with a few sprinkle of sesame.\u00a0 It was a really nicely flavoured pork belly that has good slightly firm texture and really nongreasy.\u00a0 It is a good sign that the fat has been rendered out properly.\u00a0 The slight charred taste on the bbq pork was a nice accent to the overall ramen flavour profile.\u00a0 On a rainy day with rich umamai was the best way to finish off my crazy day.\u00a0 The gyoza was crispy on the bottom, but not so juicy on the inside.
