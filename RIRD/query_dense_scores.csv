0,Italian place with a burger,"Bit of a wait at the door. No problem. Spicy kimchi ramen was good. Very good? Almost. Ginger ale float was dumb and basic.

5,Italian place with a burger,"Not sure why, but the shoyu broth and noodle here is way better than the Santouka in Vancouver. The pork jowl is absolutely delicious, but they're set aside for a reason. Don't put it all into your broth immediately (my noob mistake), or the first few pieces might taste delicious, but the rest will be overly tough while it's slowly cooked in the ramen broth. The aji tamago I added on the side was average at best (Over cooked and under seasoned? Marinated? ) ~$28 for the ramen + egg + cold tea... so decent pricing. I didn't like how they rushed you with the bill though when you're still working on your meal though. I did enjoy how they had a bar counter for the solo diners and the communal tables for the group diners though. Overall, a solid 4 star.",85.47297

10,Italian place with a burger,"It should come to no surprise that I am a huge ramen fan. I had some truly amazing ramen in Japan and have felt ramen-withdrawal since then. There are some good ramen spots in New York City, but none of them serve tsukemen, which is one of my absolute favorite finds in Tokyo. Tsukemen, or dipping ramen, features cold, al dente ramen noodles that you dip into a hot broth, which is served on the side. When I found out that HRS served it, it went onto the calendar. BF had never had them before, so it was a first for him. I felt like I hyped it up so much beforehand. Thankfully, I think it lived up to the hype for him! We arrived around 6:15pm and had a 10-15 minute wait. We were the last couple in through the door before they required everyone else to start a line outside. It got very long by the time we left. I opted to start with a melon soda float, which the BF was skeptical of at first, but really enjoyed. I think he might have been his favorite part of dinner! We both ordered their non-spicy tsukemen and it was glorious - perfect al dente noodles with a tasty, hot broth on the side. I wish the broth was a little bit thicker so it would stick more, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Quick tip for my fellow US travelers, they don't take Amex.",87.99604

15,Italian place with a burger,"WHAT TO TRY?!Their ramen!! Personally, liked their shio ramen the best because it has a rich creamy broth that is not like other ramen places. Can really taste the milky cream texture of the pork broth. Each bowl will come with two slices or pork so if you don't think that's enough, you can order the bigger portion sized one where they give you five slices of pork. They are really quick to serve your noodles shortly after you order. So don't worry about the lines! Because mean comes out very quickly!LAST TIP?! This place doesn't serve chicken or beef so they mainly only have pork broths and pork slices!! The vegetable ramen is on their secret menu in the kitchen so that's the only other ramen that doesn't have meat. And the portion size relative to Kenzo is smaller because the bowls are smaller. The prices are also more expensive than Kenzo so be aware!",83.88322

20,Italian place with a burger,Came here on a Sunday at around 6pm and there was a short line up. We (partay of 2) waited for around 15 min with maybe 4 groups ahead of us which wasnt bad.. but when we came back out the line was like 3 times as long...I got the shio ramen which was really good! Broth was creamy (but I've had creamier) and the noodles were nice and chewy. So far prob one of the best ramens I've had in Toronto. Only thing I didn't like was the meat. It came with two pieces.. one was fatty which was good but the other piece was a bit too tough for my liking.,84.12683

25,Italian place with a burger,"3.5 stars... service and craft beer variety is a 4 star.  The food... it had some gaps sadly.  Those duck fat & beef tallow fries ... Amaaaazing.  Beer bistro has been known to be for a while.  If you think the craft beer halls is all new, you need to know that Beer Bistro has been around 10 years and serving up craft beers from around the world since then.  Ground zero would be here.  The space is quite large with a huge vaulted ceilings and a large patio off to the side.  I would say it reminds me of a nice upscale bar.  Casual but not your neighbourhood spot.  There is a bar area with a few large big screens.  So if your date is wanting to watch the hockey game and pepper you non stop with questions, you got your spot.  There is also an open kitchen into the dining room so you can watch your food being created.Service here is great... on point, always available, and pleasant.  They're incredibly well informed on the many beers that is found in their encyclopedia.  She was able to help tell us which beers wouldnt be our favourite knowing that what we liked.  They always checked in on us and kept our smaller table clean of used plates.As for their beers... good god, the book was insanely long but thankfully detailed in highlighting key tasting notes.  I loved how they have many different types locally but also internationally.  I also really liked how a lot of these craft beer were so affordable... none of these crazy $14 per glass for a Toronto craft beer.  Rather we found good Collective Arts ones for only $7.50.  I love this and I hope they continue this.Hog wild flat bread - You can smell the bacon and bbq sauce as it passes your table.  Thats what made us order this one.  It's a nice size for an app... good to share among a few people.  The taste was ok... the bbq was a typical sweet sauce with not a lot of zing or flavour.  The meat on it was a touch dry and not sure cause it was dried out in the oven.  The base was really dry and with no flavour.  It was more like a dried out biscuit.  It's decent bar food.  3/5Truffled potato pierogies - Another shareable app with crisped up pierogies with a few toppings.  The inside of the pierogies was a lot but not a lot of flavour.  It was just a lot of mashed unsalted potatoes.  I didn't taste any truffles or mushroom flavours through the dish.  Visually it was appealing but not sure if there was more to it.  3/5Spicy Red Thai mussels - A generous cast iron pot arrives to your plate and it's filled with plump and hot mussels.  Not a single one was closed or had broken shells.  That was very good to see.  There was enough broth on the bottom to soak up the sauce but for the beginning, it was so hard to try to get the top mussels any flavour because you couldnt just dig down to the bottom easily.  It would have been great if they could toss all the mussels into the sauce before serving.  First world problems.  Maybe Spicy Red Thai was the wrong flavour to get but this was not spicy... I wouldnt even say it was mild or even Thai.  No ginger, galangal, or spices that reminded me of Thai mussels I had at Kiin.  So maybe go for the other broths instead.  3.5/5Belgian Frites - THIS... is what you come for.  The beef tallow and duck fat fries are just so good.  Possibly one of my favourite in Toronto so far.  Tried Wvrst and Bellwoods which are considered other top Toronto fries and Beer Bistro is the clear winner.  Every fry is super hot, crispy, doused in salt, and nicely bronzed.  This was just well executed and they give you a huge cone of it!  Just delicious... Beer and Fries at Beer Bistro.  Hell ya.  I didnt even use the sauces they gave me cause it tasted good on its own.  4.5/5Not sure if the kitchen was off that day but clearly they got some things done well.  Those fries are amazing.  I have to give credit to the staff... just attentive service from a bar is always good to me.  Definitely a good spot to try a variety of beers without feeling the hipster judgement.",85.981514

Amaaaazing.  Beer bistro has been known to be for a while.  If you think the craft beer halls is all new, you need to know that Beer Bistro has been around 10 years and serving up craft beers from around the world since then.  Ground zero would be here.  The space is quite large with a huge vaulted ceilings and a large patio off to the side.  I would say it reminds me of a nice upscale bar.  Casual but not your neighbourhood spot.  There is a bar area with a few large big screens.  So if your date is wanting to watch the hockey game and pepper you non stop with questions, you got your spot.  There is also an open kitchen into the dining room so you can watch your food being created.Service here is great... on point, always available, and pleasant.  They're incredibly well informed on the many beers that is found in their encyclopedia.  She was able to help tell us which beers wouldnt be our favourite knowing that what we liked.  They always checked in on us and kept our smaller table clean of used plates.As for their beers... good god, the book was insanely long but thankfully detailed in highlighting key tasting notes.  I loved how they have many different types locally but also internationally.  I also really liked how a lot of these craft beer were so affordable... none of these crazy $14 per glass for a Toronto craft beer.  Rather we found good Collective Arts ones for only $7.50.  I love this and I hope they continue this.Hog wild flat bread - You can smell the bacon and bbq sauce as it passes your table.  Thats what made us order this one.  It's a nice size for an app... good to share among a few people.  The taste was ok... the bbq was a typical sweet sauce with not a lot of zing or flavour.  The meat on it was a touch dry and not sure cause it was dried out in the oven.  The base was really dry and with no flavour.  It was more like a dried out biscuit.  It's decent bar food.  3/5Truffled potato pierogies - Another shareable app with crisped up pierogies with a few toppings.  The inside of the pierogies was a lot but not a lot of flavour.  It was just a lot of mashed unsalted potatoes.  I didn't taste any truffles or mushroom flavours through the dish.  Visually it was appealing but not sure if there was more to it.  3/5Spicy Red Thai mussels - A generous cast iron pot arrives to your plate and it's filled with plump and hot mussels.  Not a single one was closed or had broken shells.  That was very good to see.  There was enough broth on the bottom to soak up the sauce but for the beginning, it was so hard to try to get the top mussels any flavour because you couldnt just dig down to the bottom easily.  It would have been great if they could toss all the mussels into the sauce before serving.  First world problems.  Maybe Spicy Red Thai was the wrong flavour to get but this was not spicy... I wouldnt even say it was mild or even Thai.  No ginger, galangal, or spices that reminded me of Thai mussels I had at Kiin.  So maybe go for the other broths instead.  3.5/5Belgian Frites - THIS... is what you come for.  The beef tallow and duck fat fries are just so good.  Possibly one of my favourite in Toronto so far.  Tried Wvrst and Bellwoods which are considered other top Toronto fries and Beer Bistro is the clear winner.  Every fry is super hot, crispy, doused in salt, and nicely bronzed.  This was just well executed and they give you a huge cone of it!  Just delicious...

30,Italian place with a burger,"2.5 (but that felt too harsh)Full disclaimer, the food lived up to the hype, the service is really where they took the hit (as well as the pricey-ness overall, but that is to be expected I guess). I made a reservation on a Friday for 5pm, and they told me only upon arriving that we had a two hour seating limit (not usually an issue, except our waitress had a bad habit of disappearing for 20 minute intervals between delivering food and drinks, but I digress). The place has a warm and hoppin' atmosphere with the bar side seemingly like a financial district watering hole and the dining room at the back being more formal. The ""featured beers"" prices vary A LOT (from $7.08 - $38.50 for single pours). The ""normal beers"" in the menu are much more reasonable and so tasty! The belgian fries are delicious and crispy, with homemade ketchup. The mussels are also great! We had the brussel mussels (spicy and a little sausage-smokey), and the english mussels (like a chowder, but less rich, and a nice bacon potato taste). They come with cold bread (that should definitely be warmed for such a nice place...the small things make a BIG difference!).THIS IS ABOUT THE SAD SERVICE (so feel free to disregard): Our waitress was THE WORST! She disappeared for long stretches and failed to check in. I had to ask for ketchup 3 times before it arrived at the table. She kept bringing food to the wrong tables, seemed angry when we wanted to order more food, or drinks and was surly and rude. While everything about the restaurant seemed to scream financial district decadence, their service made them seem like your subpar suburb diner).

Blanched in beef tallow and duck fat, and served with house made mayo, they were probably some of the best fries I've ever had. Perfectly crunchy, salty and very flavourful on their own. The muscles were cooked in a flavourful broth with peppers and onions. They were tender and a little spicy and came with sourdough for dipping.

If being filling is the most important criteria then this lace gets 5 stars. However in terms of creativity/skills, this place is no different than a Pita Pit to me. Their crepes are so thick that resembles a pita bread indeed. They have a lot of fillings, I guess that's what many people like.BUT that's it! Nothing really creative or requires any special skills what so ever. Even their choice of fillings are sooooo generic like a Subway has.I would say this is more of a Pita Pit/Subway kind of food, is it even better than that? I would not think so.

75,Italian place with a burger,"Preface: this review is for the dinner experience, NOT the dim sum experience (which isn't offered in the evenings).When we first walked in, we noticed two things. First, the decorations. The whole restaurant is covered in gold and white cloth, from the floor to the chairs to the tables. The servers are all wearing fancy suits, and there's even a wall with a ton of wine bottles. It's not fancy like a steakhouse, but it looks nice, rather than faux-fancy. And second, we noticed the seafood tanks! You can observe the live seafood swimming and crawling around, including king crabs, lobsters, fish, shrimp, and geoduck (one of the largest edible clams!). They were all a lot of fun to watch.Once we got to our table, we were presented with a challenge: navigating the menu. There are TWO menus, each containing well over 100 items, and many of them don't have clear prices. On top of that, some of the items were only in Chinese. If you're not Chinese yourself, figuring out what to order can be quite complicated. We asked for advice from our server, but that didn't help us narrow down - it just left us with even more options. It seemed like some of the dishes were more authentic, whereas others were more ""tourist-friendly."" We ended up getting the ""dinner for 4"" (the one with BBQ pork, since there are two different ""dinners for 4"" - one per menu), plus some fresh scallops.The dinner came with multiple different dishes which we shared family-style. Some of them were great, such as the soup, the BBQ pork (which was the highlight), and the stir-fried shrimp. Some were just ok, such as the scallops and the fish. Others were disappointing, such as the bok choy and the dessert. I think there's a bit of a learning curve - you need to figure out what's good (and what you like) in order to maximize your enjoyment.Overall, the meal was certainly unique, and on the whole we had a good time. But the confusing ordering experience and the hit-or-miss nature of the dishes made it not as great as it could've been. If you know what you're doing, then you'll probably have a good time here. If you don't, then just be flexible and prepared!",82.76704

If I were to weight it, the average would be a four since service was about a three--Service was slow and very few English speakers. The people who we were able to talk to were professional but it was so busy that it was hard to get their attention.My wife and I really liked this restaurant's menu which was quite extensive compared to other Dim Sums. The food was great! I wouldn't say it was the best Dim Sum I've ever had but it's hard to compare. The thing we liked best was the uniqueness of some of the dishes. Most of the Dim Sum places around my hometown serve similar items to other cities we've been to like in L.A. or N.Y.C., almost cookie-cutter Dim Sum. But this place had a lot of different and new dishes that we had never seen before. Presentation (food and plating) was nice and everything tasted delicious.

It could definitely get expensive if you're a big eater but it's so worth trying for a special occasion.Their nigiri sushi and jabistro rolls are good but the absolute must orders are the aburi/pressed sushi selection. So creamy it literally melts in your mouth!! Seriously so impressed with everything I've tried from here. Con: parking is pricy bc of location; subway there if you can!5/5!!!,89.32409

Although pricey and on the higher end of restaurants, this place is worth every buck. Came here for my birthday last weekend and we loved it! The waiter was very patient as it was our first time and we weren't sure what to order. We ended up with favourites that were recommended by our waiter. Started with the hakkaido salad and sashimi platter to share and each got our own kyukyoku and aburi. Note: should've shared the kyukyoku and aburi as well; having our own was way too much food (although we did finish it all). All 4 dishes were amazing! Great presentation and variety. The sashimi melted like butter in our mouths. Did I mention this place was worth every buck? Our dessert was the creme brûlée and green tea ice cream. As the biggest creme brûlée enthusiast, this made it to my top creme brulees in the city! Loved it! JaBistro does their version for winterlicious and summerlicious twice a year.

155,Italian place with a burger,"I love Kastu, it's such a basic concept. You get a thin slice of meat and then you coat it in egg wash then coat it in breadcrumbs before you fry it. I love doing it at home so part of me wondered how good can Fat Ninja Bite's Katsu be? Well it's amazing! Their Katsu is just the flakiest yet light and crispy. It's crazy delicious.We went and tried their sandwich with the chicken Katsu in dark meat and the pork Don Katsu with rice. I'll tell you now that the sandwich was a clear 5/5 while the rice was 4/5. The sandwich has so many components to it and together was more hormonious.  I also preferred the chicken over the pork. Even though the pork was indeed tender, the chicken was juicier and a lighter chew worked better. The sandwich had tomatoes, lettuce, slaw, and even pickles, brought together by a nice spicy mayo. As you've seen the cutlet itself, is way bigger than the bun itself, we ate the second cutlet on it's own. What I really liked was their sauce. It's sweet and slightly tangy. It resembles something of a teriyaki sauce and it's excellent. The rice plate was more ordinary and just featured the Katsu with rice and slaw. Again, you get two cutlets, and there's a ton of food here. The slaw is pretty ordinary, it would be interesting if FNB offered a more traditional thinly sliced and lightly dressed cabbage slaw instead a mayo based one.",84.530235

We ordered the chicken katsu burger and katsu rice. The chicken Katsu was huge and can easily make 2 burgers, I believe you can also have them cut it for you and have double layers in your burger. The pork katsu was very nice as while. Both were very flavourful and filling! Came with coleslaw. Food was made fresh and did not take long at all.We also got to sample the tarp chips!

The hanger steak was cooked to my liking - medium rare. The herb butter and the au jus that came with it was a match in heaven. The blend of herbs and seasoning they use on their skinny fries was very unique and tasty.I would definitely recommend this place.,85.194336

200,Italian place with a burger,"Visited this Toronto famous pizzeria a few weekends ago during their down time around 3ish on a Sunday. I know there are a few around the city but wanted to try the original.The staff was nice and we got a table by their front open window which had a nice breeze and gorgeous view of their restaurant. We ordered their arancini and nduja sausage pizza, the arancini was crispy on the outside, warm and gooey on the inside with amazing tomato sauce to top it all with. Fresh and still making my mouth water now. The pizza on the other hand was disappointing... the dough in the middle was soggy and seemed a bit underdone. The cheesy which I wished was gooey was very watery, which explains the sogginess. The crust itself was delicious and chewy like it should be but if we had more time I would have said something to our waiter. Or if he had come back to check in. Ended up paying at the counter. A bit disappointed with this visit but thought maybe it really was a down time.",95.5885

205,Italian place with a burger,"short wait on a Saturday (20 mins) is always a great place to start.Every single person we interacted with was lovely, and attentive. You cannot ask for more than that.The restaurant was buzzing when we arrived at 9ish. Good vibe, staff looked to be having a great time. We ordered Caprese salad & Calamari to start and 2 pizzas for our main.Calamari was fantastic, better than average (for battered calamari) with a larger than average portion, also great. Odd that there was no accompanying sauce (aoili at least?)Caprese - This is a very, very poor and somewhat sad version of this Italian standard. Enormous thick slices of Beefsteak tomatoes inter cut with small thin slices of bocconcini. The ratio was off. The markup on the ingredients is assinine - from roughly 80 cents for the tomato and $1 for the bocconcini used to over $10. Very little olive oil, basil. No salt, pepper, oregano or dried seasoning of any sort. This menu item deserves better. This is Chef Boyardee in its overall presentation. The dough/crust on the 2 pizza was delightful - top quality. Didn't love the sauce, absolutely missing key spices and/or some salt. Objectively speaking the cheese is sub par. The fresh bocconcini isnt to the standard that should be used for a stone over pizza. Thank god the basil was there to help in our pizza's time of need.",92.64828

Served on house made labneh.Mushroom pita/12 hour braised lamb and kale, black bean and lentil rice were all thoroughly enjoyed as well!Middle Eastern Fried Chicken, family really enjoyed this they said it was crispy on the outside and the hot sauce and tahini added tons of flavour.

My mom tried and loved the rose's shadow which was Pomegranate, lemon juice, rose water, and hibiscus.The service was attentive and consistent, top notch!My only complaint was that it was uncomfortably warm upstairs throughout the meal. but won't deter me from returning :)",88.53875

Though they pretty much put their dukkah on everything, it was delicious and I didn't mind it one bit.  The steak tartare and the octopus were my two favorite starters.  The steak tartare was one of the best I've had.For the mains, we ordered the crispy duck confit rice, short rib kebab,  whole branzino along with a side of the seared cauliflower.  To be honest, we weren't HUGE fans of the entrees.  The appetizers were, to us, more impressive.  Also, our server had mentioned she would course everything out for us so that not everything came at once.  But when ALL our entrees came at once and I commented to her, all she said was ""Yep, they're all here!""The crispy duck confit rice was pretty heavy on what tasted like star anise but I really enjoy the texture.  The short rib, for whatever reason, came lukewarm. I took food photos but I'm generally a one-and-done type photographer (not high caliber) so it doesn't explain why the short rib was already lukewarm by the time we dug in.  The fish was ok...somewhat on the fishy side...but the saffron sauce which I was apprehensive about ended up saving the dish.Dessert was another highlight of the evening.  The pavlova was a foregone conclusion due to the theatrics of cracking it open but it ended up being supremely tasty as well.  First meringue I've had that was tangy and not cloyingly sweet.  We also got the baklava which we had totally discounted thinking it was heavy. On recommendation from our server, though, we decided to give it a go.  It was amazingly light and delicious as well.Overall a good meal...and I would probably come back if we were ever in town again (hopefully)...but I would probably cobble together dinner from among the appetizer section or try other entrees.",82.63338

245,Italian place with a burger,"An absolutely exquisite meal! Came here with a party of three... Although my expectations were high coming into the restaurant, the food still well exceeded my standards. I was completely blown away! We reserved our table well in advance (a month ago), so this was a long awaited meal.The waitress told us that the style of Byblos is sharing plates, and that roughly 6 plates would be needed to serve the three of us. Naively, we told her that since we had small appetites, we shouldn't need six plates. Little did we know... The food was so addicting, and the portions were fairly small, leading us to order round after round after round.We started off with a couple appetizers, outlined below.Turkish Manti Dumplings:I've heard so many different things about this dish - some people love it, others find it too bland. We loved it! The flavours were super complex; although being completely vegetarian, it didn't taste it at all. The eggplant had a rich smokey flavour that accentuated the dish. The creamy halloumi and tangy yogurt balanced the salty flavour of the eggplant. I didn't really taste the sweetness of the molasses, and really enjoyed the crisp dumpling surface contrasted with the creamy sauce. Fig Salad:The first and foremost flavour that jumps out at you when eating this salad is the floral taste, stemming from the orange blossom vinaigrette. The tangy vinegar had a very delicate blossom undertone; I could truly taste the fragrance and perfume of the orange blossom. The figs added a nice touch of sweetness; however, there were very little pieces. When we brought that up to the waitress, she was kind enough to accommodate and brought us a dish of a fresh fig cut up. The fig was delightfully fresh! I liked this salad - however, given its high price point, it was a small portion with few ingredients.For the mains, we had a variety of different dishes such as the following.Tah-Dig:This is a classic Mediterranean dish with crispy rice, and surprisingly small for its ingredients and price (I think I'm seeing a trend). That said, the rice was addicting crispy and delicious! The lamb was braised to be fall apart tender, and the warm figs highlighted and lightened the meal. The nuts were a nice addition. Grilled Whole Banzino:This was by far my favourite dish of the entire meal! It was my first time having chermoullah, a pesto-like savoury salty sauce. The parsley and cilantro green dressing with the lemon juice really lightened up the grilled fish. The skin was also the right amount of crisp. I was amazed by this dish, and ate every single last piece.Ora King Salmon:We didn't have enough, and so ordered this additional protein. The four pieces of salmon were grilled to a perfect char, rendering the skin crispy. Meanwhile, the salmon was cooked just right - the inside was moist and tender. It was the perfect pink, and by no means dry. The harissa sauce was a lovely spicy addition. Though good, it didn't stand up to the banzino for me.Crispy Hand Rolled Couscous:This dish was very similar to the Tah-Dig in that it was likewise crispy. That said, I enjoyed this dish so much more! The creamy halloumi with the collard greens was absolutely delicious. I'm not a fan of cheese, but this and the Manti Dumplings really won me over.We ended the meal with a dessert. We couldn't decide between the baklava and pavlova (both executed in fusion style), but the waitress recommended the baklava.Stuffed Baklava:This dish had mint ice cream stuffed inside crispy pastry (similar to a cannoli), sprinkled with pistachios and topped with a dark chocolate mousse. It was an interesting mix and juxtaposition of flavours and textures - the crisp of the pastry and pistachio contrasted with the creamy mousse/chocolate and ice cream. The sweetness of the dark chocolate and ice cream was cut by the sudden addition of sea salt. To be honest, this dessert wasn't my favourite as the salt caught me off guard. However, I did enjoy the dark chocolate and pistachios. Most certainly an interesting dessert style.This place is quite pricey, so save up!

I didn't really taste the sweetness of the molasses, and really enjoyed the crisp dumpling surface contrasted with the creamy sauce. Fig Salad:The first and foremost flavour that jumps out at you when eating this salad is the floral taste, stemming from the orange blossom vinaigrette. The tangy vinegar had a very delicate blossom undertone; I could truly taste the fragrance and perfume of the orange blossom. The figs added a nice touch of sweetness; however, there were very little pieces. When we brought that up to the waitress, she was kind enough to accommodate and brought us a dish of a fresh fig cut up. The fig was delightfully fresh! I liked this salad - however, given its high price point, it was a small portion with few ingredients.For the mains, we had a variety of different dishes such as the following.Tah-Dig:This is a classic Mediterranean dish with crispy rice, and surprisingly small for its ingredients and price (I think I'm seeing a trend). That said, the rice was addicting crispy and delicious! The lamb was braised to be fall apart tender, and the warm figs highlighted and lightened the meal. The nuts were a nice addition. Grilled Whole Banzino:This was by far my favourite dish of the entire meal! It was my first time having chermoullah, a pesto-like savoury salty sauce. The parsley and cilantro green dressing with the lemon juice really lightened up the grilled fish. The skin was also the right amount of crisp. I was amazed by this dish, and ate every single last piece.Ora King Salmon:We didn't have enough, and so ordered this additional protein. The four pieces of salmon were grilled to a perfect char, rendering the skin crispy. Meanwhile, the salmon was cooked just right - the inside was moist and tender. It was the perfect pink, and by no means dry. The harissa sauce was a lovely spicy addition. Though good, it didn't stand up to the banzino for me.Crispy Hand Rolled Couscous:This dish was very similar to the Tah-Dig in that it was likewise crispy. That said, I enjoyed this dish so much more! The creamy halloumi with the collard greens was absolutely delicious. I'm not a fan of cheese, but this and the Manti Dumplings really won me over.We ended the meal with a dessert. We couldn't decide between the baklava and pavlova (both executed in fusion style), but the waitress recommended the baklava.Stuffed Baklava:This dish had mint ice cream stuffed inside crispy pastry (similar to a cannoli), sprinkled with pistachios and topped with a dark chocolate mousse. It was an interesting mix and juxtaposition of flavours and textures - the crisp of the pastry and pistachio contrasted with the creamy mousse/chocolate and ice cream. The sweetness of the dark chocolate and ice cream was cut by the sudden addition of sea salt. To be honest, this dessert wasn't my favourite as the salt caught me off guard. However, I did enjoy the dark chocolate and pistachios. Most certainly an interesting dessert style.This place is quite pricey, so save up! Moreover, come with a larger group to both split the cost and share more things. Next time, I will definitely try the pavlova (the table next to us seemed to thoroughly enjoy it) and the sweet jewelled rice!",92.297104

There was no dressing, and I tasted only 2 pieces of butternut squash. It was not filling at all, and consisted of mainly only salad leaves.

My husband had  Baked Sablefish with lobster tail. Fish is excellent, lobster is ok. Dessert is great, we both had green tea opera. I tried Japanese whiskey for first time, I think I will stick to my Scotch.  Next time to visit, I will focus on sushi only.",93.50388
285,Italian place with a burger,"Amazing. Some of the BEST sushi I've ever tasted! My friends and I were thoroughly impressed with the food. I love that each piece of sushi is super flavourful and it does not require soy sauce at all - you can tell each piece was carefully thought through and made. The chefs recommend you eat each piece without any soy sauce because they were made to be enjoyed without it. I was literally making sounds after I had each piece of sushi - it's that good. Yes, this place is quite pricey.. but it really is a great place to try, maybe for special occasions or events when you are craving some quality sushi and don't want to get all you can eat. The average price of a dish is probably $18.00 I would say, but a lot of the dishes were made for sharing with friends so definitely come with a party. They also have a lengthy drink menu with some unique cocktails - I very much enjoyed the Miyazaki drinks. I'll definitely be back to try more of the sushi!",82.82523

305,Italian place with a burger,One of my favourite noodle houses in Toronto! If you're looking for a quick place to satisfy your noodlely cravings then GB hand-pulled noodles is the place to visit.I always order either the Special Lanzhou noodles or the Noodles with Homemade Pork Sauce. You really can't go wrong with either. The ingredients are always super fresh and flavourful. There's a decent noodle to toppings ratio and you probably won't have to deal with any bites that are only noodles. Service is prompt you will be expected to have your order ready while you are waiting in line and your food will arrive shortly after you sit down. Most smaller groups will have to share tables so don't expect to have an intimate date here... The price is also decent expect to pay around $15 per person after tax and tip. Overall would definitely recommend for my fellow noodle lovers!,87.249275

While the noodles themselves were very good and cooked perfectly, the broth itself lacked depth and was just salty.Menu also lacked diversity; I was hoping for maybe some stir fried noodles, but only soups or dry noodles were available.If you never had hand pulled noodles before, I would recommend. If you have already tried hand pulled noodles, I would recommend other places instead.",89.9445
325,Italian place with a burger,"Visited for the first time for dinner on a Friday.Pros:- Busy intersection, easily reached via TTC. No free parking and paid green P easily accessible.- Phone reservations highly encouraged. Seats were available when promised.- Good selection of beverages, cocktails and sake- Interior is nicely decorated- Oyster topping sauces had lots of variety - $1 oysters on Tues and Wed.- Friendly and attentive staff- Fried shrimp dish was yummy- Free cheesecake if you're celebrating your birthday (almost every table was celebrating a birthday...)Cons/Improvements:- Was looking for a larger selection of food menus and more authentic Japanese dishes. Most of the dishes were fusion styled and quite overpriced. $20 for a 8 piece roll and $50 for a 30 piece sashimi- Sake menu perhaps can include pictures / Kanji for those who recognize the label or Japanese name. - Bigger portions rather than making customers pay for multiple dishes to accompany their alcohol- Improve quality of sushi and sashimi - they weren't bad, but I was hoping for more luxury varieties like uni or toro for the price I paid.Summary:The ambience is great for a tapas style gathering with friends along with alcoholic beverages (what an izakaya should be) However, if you are looking for authentic Japanese cuisine and dining experience, this may not be the place for you. Our group of 4 ended up grabbing ramen down the street to fill us up.",84.27745

360,Italian place with a burger,"Certainly La Carnita knows how to make delicious tacos. Each taco order comes with one taco so I decided to mix and match and tried a fish one, a chicken one, and a steak one.In Cod We Trust (favourite)The cod was soft, fluffy, and lightly battered on the outside. It also comes with ""Voltron sauce"" which is La Carnita's secret sauce named after a cartoon super robot lol. It uses ""tamari"" soy sauce as the base and I felt that it paired well with the cod. The extra cabbage, green apple, and cilantro on top complemented well with the fluffy cod by adding some crunch to it.Pollo Frito (almost tied with steak but I ranked this as my second favourite because it was slightly sweeter from the honey)  Crispy chicken thigh, peanut mole,honey, Rossy's hot sauce, green cabbage & salsa frescaThe chicken was nice and sweet and also tender and slightly crispy on the outside. If you like sweet stuff definitely try the pollo. Beware though that while the chicken is sweet some parts of the taco can also be spicier than expected from hot sauce.Carne Asada - Grilled Beef Steak, chipotle mayo, Tomatillo salsa, Lime Avocado, Crispy Shallots & cilantro. The steak was good but the salsa and mayo were a little too spicy (tasted like spicy mayo but stronger). For tacos I preferred the chicken and fish because of the lighter texture to go with the delicate tortillaFor starters we tried the ancho bbq wing but in comparison to the tacos they were more dry and somewhat small.

We were a party of 5, and the table reserved for us was at the back of the restaurant where the music was a little quieter and cozy.. and we had more privacy which I appreciated. We were here on a Thursday night at about 8:30, the restaurant was not that busy but it would still be a good idea to make reservation if you come with a bigger group.  We got the Thursday special, 100 for 100 malpeques, coconut mussels, chicken liver & oyster pate, calamari, fish & chips and a grilled sea bream. I was most impressed with the calamari, chicken liver & oyster pate, and fish & chips. Everything else was good but they did not wow me. They had a good selection of drinks, but they were pretty pricey. In terms of service, the waiters were knowledgeable and attentive, they made sure that our water was filled, checked in with us a few times during our meal, and refilled our toasts for the pate.  I would definitely come back to try other oysters!",84.67008

This may be the best pasta dish I've eat had - and I've never been the hugest fan of mushrooms! The portion size also exceeded my expectations and I ended up even packing it (and I eat a lot so...lol). Would highly recommend to anyone! Afterwards I kept getting the same dish delivered and once added tried their burger on a whim. Is everything on their menu just amazing?!!

405,Italian place with a burger,"This restaurant is a nice place to drink and socialize, but not great to eat (more on this below). Outdoor patio is great but fills up fast so come early to get a table. The interior has a warehouse feel with concrete construction, high ceilings and large windows for a lot of light. The downside was the food... some of the dishes were great but some were very mediocre. My favorite dishes were the scallops and arugula salad. The octopus was overcooked and the texture/flavor was not great. Also the mushroom pasta was bland.Another con is that the food took FOREVER to arrive.

410,Italian place with a burger,"I had a good time here!The restaurant is super cool and trendy, and the food is really good!I came here on a Friday night with a group of 5 people and we had a reservation for 6:30. It wasn't super busy but by the time we left it had really filled out and had a lineup out the door. The restaurant is dimly lit and has a really cool industrial look to it. We were sat upstairs and am told that the roof opens up in the warmer months to make a giant outdoor patio, I'd love to come back in the summer to check that out. Our server was pretty attentive, they were nice about giving us extra time to select drinks and food and we didn't feel rushed at all. A few times the food came to the table and was given to the wrong person but it wasn't a big deal. For the food, I ordered the kale salad, I liked it, I found it a bit salty with all the cheese, but I liked the pine nuts and currants for texture, it was also a very large salad, I think it could be easily shared as a side for two people. I ordered the cacio e pepe pasta which was really good. The noodles were cooked perfectly and I really liked the taste of the sauce and the pepper. It looked like a small portion but it ended up being quite rich and salty and I actually had a hard time finishing it. I'm not a fan of mushrooms but a few people had the mushroom mafalde pasta and enjoyed it, they also loved the mushroom bruschetta. Lastly, I tried a piece of the steak and it was good, cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned, it wasn't outstanding but definitely solid. I liked the sourdough bread too, although I think it was a bit pricey for bread, which is often free at other restaurants. I didn't order wine but it's $1 per ounce which is a great deal. Overall this is a really cool place and the menu is pretty extensive so I think everyone could find something suitable. Prices are not outrageous, I think they're appropriate for the food quality and portion. I would definitely come back to maybe try one of their specials, unfortunately lasagna was on special for a different day, and also to experience the open roof in the summer!",87.61378

420,Italian place with a burger,"I loved the setting and layout of the restaurant! It's located in the heart of downtown.It was a sunny afternoon and we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. If you'd like to sit outside on the patio, I recommend making reservations and bringing sunglasses! Our waitress was kind and helpful when it came to asking for a dessert and candle for my boyfriend (not complimentary - you do have to pay for it). It was a success and he was definitely surprised! However, the service was quite slow for brunch and perhaps that was due to the busy hour. I wasn't too bothered by it, as were some people.I ordered a Berry bowl because I was feeling 'fruity', however I wasn't too happy with the overall taste of it. It was more on the sour side and I prefer sweet - plus the yogurt was actual warm rather than cold. I've never had warm yogurt served as part of a berry bowl. Don't get me wrong, I still ate it but it wasn't the best. Probably WOULDN'T recommend that order. Although, my boyfriend ordered the Gusto burger and he found it to be flavourful and well cooked, so based on how happy he was with his meal I'd recommend it too! Lastly, I had to top off our brunch date with a Sangria and I have no complaints about it. Tasted just perfect. Overall I'd say Gusto 101 is a nice spot to catch up with friends or have a one on one date. Bound to have a good time here!",94.50278

Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen - Best. Ramen. Ever. If you love smokiness in everything (in food, cocktails, weed LMAO just kidding), you will love this one. Highly recommend. #一試難忘2. Vegetarian Ramen with Creamy Potato Soy Milk Broth - Hella yass. This one is so creamy good; I wanted to drink all the broth lol. Though it is vegetarian, I added braised pork belly (+$3) for my meat-lover self lol.3. Signature Clam Broth Ramen (Shio) - Definitely a classic at Konjiki. If you have never had calm broth before, this will blow yo' mind! It is actually very light compared to the usual chicken- or pork-based.I have yet to try the ramen with lobster broth!

I had the smoky black tonkotsu and it was amazing.  You can really taste the quality and time put in to the broth which is the most important part of ramen for me.  The noodles were very good as well.  Ramen noodles should be served aldente so there's some bite to it.  Konjiki does an excellent job of this.  The karaage is probably the best I've ever had at a ramen restaurant.  When a restaurant puts that much effort into it's side dishes, you know that's a great thing!I have but one beef with his place but unfortunately it's a big one for me.  I'm a big eater and I can eat a ton of noodles in one sitting.  I always get extra noodles when I have ramen.  This place doesn't have that option.  If I want extra noodles I have to get another bowl which is another $15, not happening.  It's the only ramen place I've been to that doesn't offer this option.  This place would easily be a 5 star if not for this.No extra noodle option withstanding, this place is a must try for all ramen lovers.  For bigger eaters like me, you might want to have a snack before or after.",86.41126

Because it received a Michelin star In another country I wanted to try this place out. Their broths are definitely different than your regular broth. I've been here maybe about 3-4 times now and I keep going to see maybe if the flavours have changed and it has! When they had line ups the broths were not d flavourful maybe because they had to rush and make orders since there were more people.I'm not so fond of their noodles either because it doesn't seem as authentic. They are straight noodles but the one I had was a bit hard for my liking. The pricing here is average. It could go a little cheaper based on what I'm getting.

440,Italian place with a burger,"It's taken me a week to process my experience and finally come up with a rating. Despite some negatives, I'm giving Konjiki 4-stars. We came here on a Sunday night, looking for a warm & quick meal. Konjiki fit both categories. To my surprise, we were seated immediately at the communal table which fits about 20 people. There are only several tables on the perimeter of the restaurant that provide some privacy. Nevertheless, right after we were seated (around 6:00 pm) a lineup started forming in the entryway. We ordered the Asahi Dry Black Beer ($8.00), Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen (13.00), and the Intense Shoyu Clam Broth Ramen ($14.00). The drinks came immediately, whereas the ramen took another 10 minutes to arrive. The service is quick, pleasant and efficient--no complaints there. The food, however, has some inconsistencies. The Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen was overpowering in flavour. When I eat ramen, I make sure to finish my broth. This, however, wasn't one of those instances. The intensity of the flavour came from the fat content in the broth & the amount of salt.The smokiness only came through in the cherry tomatoes (surprisingly). The Clam Broth Ramen was good, but I had the opposite issue with the broth--it was underwhelming. There simply wasn't enough seafood flavour. The portions are also fairly small for the price. Conclusion? I'm in love with the creativity that goes into the ramen, as well as the selection of unique flavours. Would I return? Perhaps, but Konjiki is not my favourite ramen spot in the neighbourhood.",83.28945

445,Italian place with a burger,"I came here with 2 other friends to try Konjiki's lobster ramen on a Wednesday. We all ordered the same thing, lobster ramen + tamago (egg).The ramen had a generous portion of well cooked (e.g. not chewy) lobster meat. The lobster had a hint of sweetness to it. I also like how they added a small amount of lobster roe? the orange-yellow paste on top of the lobster. Some people might find it a bit fishy, but to me it was the essence! The broth, on the other hand, fell short of my expectations. The broth had a promising orange-red colour, which suggested they simmered the lobster shells. However, all 3 of us agreed that we could not taste any component of seafood in the broth. I was glad I added the egg. It was not salty like many ramen restaurants. And despite eating the egg approximately half way through my ramen, the yolk was still 50% runny!The appearance of the sous vide cha siu reminded me of sliced ham from the deli counter. So my expectations for it was set quite low. However, after taking a few bites, I actually quite enjoyed it. Despite it's ""smooth"" looking appearance, there was still the texture of meat. The ramen noodles were alright, not too memorable. I don't see myself getting the lobster ramen again, it's more of a ""tried it once and it's sufficient"" type of dish.

I would have a really hard time deciding between the two, as the pulled pork one was also amazing.

We decided to get the Cairo classic, the chicken sandwich, falafel app, eggplant appetizer and their honey cardamom latte. We were 3 and found that to be plenty of food.Let me say that these are THE BEST falafels I've ever had and I've had plenty. The sauce that's given, which is a spicy tahini mix was to die for. The eggplant appetizer was delicious as well. Eating it with their homemade pita bread...oh my I'm salivating. The Cairo classic and chicken sandwich were also very good. I thought the chicken was a bit too saucy and it was hard to taste the chicken. The foul was very good, but I wish there was mooooore!! Finally, the latte was superb. I could have had it all day.

The honey cardamom tasted like coffee with a hint of spice. Lentil soup was amazing, light and creamy (I believe vegan as well). All the dishes were different and fresh. Would definitely drop by again! Portions were more than filling for one person. Price was average about $15 per meal. Our bill came to about $90 for three people. Staff were really nice and friendly!

500,Italian place with a burger,"I was over hyped about the chicken and waffles after seeing some of the delicious photos but after tasting the food it didn't live up to the expectations.I ordered the duck taco appetizer which was a good fusion of western and eastern foods. I enjoyed the taco but just wish the duck was warmed up before being placed on the dish.For the main course I got, what I mentioned above, the chicken and waffles. At first sight, I was felt pretty good about the way the dish was plated. It looked pretty just like the photos. The fried chicken was the main selling part of this dish, it was seasoned, juicy and crispy. The chicken is seasoned with a bit of ginger which I think elevated the taste of the heavy dish. But the waffles was a huge disappointment to me. It was soggy and had this weird texture to it. It tasted like something too healthy to be together with the awesome tasting fried chicken. The syrup for the waffles tastes good too.If they can fix the waffles then this will be a five star dish.",82.40935

Now as I understand tacos in general are never really cheap. I wasn't quite full and I didn't feel it was that amazing. I will update this review upon my next visit.,90.09346
520,Italian place with a burger,"I'm always trying to find brunch spots around Markham, but I have to say that Inspire is still one of the best in the city.Small little restaurant in Main St Markham but always full of people. The best is definitely their chicken and waffles as you get the fluffiness from the waffles with a hint of sweet while getting a textural difference of crispness from the fried chicken. The sweet and savory is balanced really well, so if that's your cup of tea you definitely need to try it.I also had their waffles with pulled pork. Great dish but I think I prefer the chicken as the pulled pork was very saucy (yet delicious) but a bit heavy for me so I would want to take a break from it.Would definitely come back to try the other things on the menu. My friends all enjoyed their dishes but we agree that the chicken and waffles are the best!",86.684296

525,Italian place with a burger,Authentic Thai food! Came here for dinner recently around 8:30PM- unfortunately two of the food we were interested in were out of stock for the day. Otherwise our alternative orders were still just as delicious. Definitely try their Thai Iced Tea. We ordered: fried garlic shrimp (big? delicious and juicy shrimps); khao soi with chicken (always a favourite) and the pad gra prao. I've heard great things about their pad Thai so I definitely need to try that next time.,81.84376

530,Italian place with a burger,The pad Thai was really really good and very flavorful but the large noodles in the pad see ew were a bit tasteless compared to the pad Thai that my husband had gotten. I was super excited to try this place and although my husband loved his food I was a bit disappointed. I think I would come back just to get the pad Thai though that was really good. I had no idea how tiny this place was and how easily it could've been missed but lesson learned. I came on a Tuesday afternoon at 2 PM and was happy to get seated immediately!,83.02194

545,Italian place with a burger,"My friend and I had both wanted to try this place for a long time, so we came here last night. We arrived at around 5:45/6 and were seated immediately - no wait. However, when we left at around 7, the lineup was almost out the door. So come early if you can!The restaurant is located on a quiet, not so busy street which is nice, and the atmosphere inside is pretty laid back. We sat downstairs but they have some upstairs seating as well.The service was fast and friendly, our orders were taken within minutes and the water refills were instant - which is a big deal for me!The food itself was great. I had the pad gra prow and my friend had the green curry. The pad gra prow is becoming my go to dish at Thai restaurants and this one was amazing. There is a large portion of meat (I got the ground pork), and the flavour is really good. We both also liked the green curry a lot because it seemed a bit lighter than most other places' green curries, but still had the same great taste.This will definitely become one of my go to restaurants downtown!",86.462616

565,Italian place with a burger,"My favourite thing about this place is the high ceiling which the large paintings which set a really atmosphere atmosphere. Hosts also asked to hang our jackets when as walk in. Came here with 3 girlfriends and we ordered a sangria to start - which to be honest wasn't that great. Then we had a bottle from the beverage menu which was quite extensive. Ordered a couple Paella which is there shared dishes and they were all delicious - the braised beef being the best. I also ordered the chicken from the main course which was cooked with a sweet sauce served with pecans on top - was really good. Place is great, menu is more on the pricier side. So I'd say ideal for a nice date dinner I'd say or business dinner as it's a little more formal.",85.78779

Then we had a bottle from the beverage menu which was quite extensive. Ordered a couple Paella which is there shared dishes and they were all delicious - the braised beef being the best. I also ordered the chicken from the main course which was cooked with a sweet sauce served with pecans on top - was really good. Place is great, menu is more on the pricier side.

570,Italian place with a burger,"We can say that Patria on King Street is the place to be if you want a relaxing brunch. It takes brunch to another level with its unique menu, intimate atmosphere and attentive servers. It does not have the same ""it's bright outside"" brunch dive; the room is dim, just perfect for those eyes who were out late partying the night before. Despite its fine dining setting, Patria's prices are competitive. Huevos Escalfado, for example, would only cost you $16. Your bill goes up depending on how much alcohol you would have. Even the price of coffee is competitive - less than $5. This is probably one of my favourite brunch places - away from crying children, the noise of banging utensils and smell of greasy potatoes.",86.52117

It is a great little hole-in-the-wall restaurant... which is literally a tiny hole in the wall.  If possible, ask to be seated outside!The Guacamole/Salsa were great - and was a good size to share among 4 people.  Would definitely recommend. We ordered a number of plates to share... but to be honest, I was not blown away by their tacos.  Definitely much bigger than El Carnita - that's for sure, and MUCH better value - but the taste was pretty average. We ordered... Tacos de: Pollo al Carbon, Pescado, Carnitas.The Mexican Street Corn is always my favourite part of these types of restaurants! Must have. The waiter was fantastic, and gave us a really cool run-down and lesson on types of Tequilas and Margaritas.  We were very appreciative!

595,Italian place with a burger,I'm always looking to try New Mexican places In toronto so we went to playa cabana . The place is fair small and has an authentic Mexican ambiance . I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time especially for dinner as there is limited seating . The service was a little slow overall. We ordered three appetizers Chips and salsa - 4/5 - the salsa felt like it was lacking flavourCorn - you get 4 pieces of corn - 3/5 - the corn was sweet instead of being spicy or more flavourful. Chorizo conquistador - 3/5 - basically bbq chorizo slices .For the mains we chose to get 3 hard and 3 soft tacos . Unlike other Mexican restaurants you cannot pick individual tacos . You have to get 3 of the same kind - hard or soft Hard chorizo taco - 5/5 - hands down the best thing we ate there. It was full of flavour and spice. It came with guacamole and salsa . The ground chorizo was way tastier than the appetizer chorizo slices . Soft taco - chicken with mango 2/5 - no flavour at all in the chicken . It was cold and lacked flavour all together . Either the chicken was made hours ago or the chef didn't put any time into preparing it . We are 1.5 of the 3 tacos and let the rest go back For dessert - you have 3 choices We opted for cheesecake with caramel . The cake was average and it was the equivalent of a grocery store cake . Overall - the ambience and select items showed potential but not sure if we are going to go back here as there are several other Mexican places that might be better . Will keep searching other hidden gems !!!,85.501015

600,Italian place with a burger,"First time coming here because I usually avoid places with lineups like the plague anddddd mannnn every time I drive past this place I see a lineup. Finally came on a Friday afternoon around 1:45PM and it was still busy, but luckily they had 2 bar stool seatings left just for us. Parking was a bit of a struggle, when we went the front parking was all full as was the parking on the side (also, alot of the parking is reserved for their neighbouring units). Not sure if they changed the ordering system or what, but we were a bit confused during our visit. Instead of ordering at the front like the others mentioned, the server was walking around taking orders and left the front unmanned. Whateva no matter really, just seemed a bit pointless to have him walking around taking orders. We just shared an Eggs Benedict w Smoked Salmon, Portabello shrooms, & Kale. This came with fried mini potatoes and a small, light salad. The potatoes and salad were fresh. But the eggs benny thooooooo... :( . My first qualm was with the English muffin it was on, it ain't toasted which makes it quite difficult to slice with the provided butter knife. Second complaint, that raw kale. I don't get it...why RAW? Imo, lightly sauteed kale with some seasoning would've made this dish much better. Kale doesn't really give you that crunch factor if that was the reasoning for adding it (nor does it really add any flavour). Also , the amount of portabello mushrooms were weak today.

Finally came on a Friday afternoon around 1:45PM and it was still busy, but luckily they had 2 bar stool seatings left just for us. Parking was a bit of a struggle, when we went the front parking was all full as was the parking on the side (also, alot of the parking is reserved for their neighbouring units). Not sure if they changed the ordering system or what, but we were a bit confused during our visit. Instead of ordering at the front like the others mentioned, the server was walking around taking orders and left the front unmanned. Whateva no matter really, just seemed a bit pointless to have him walking around taking orders. We just shared an Eggs Benedict w Smoked Salmon, Portabello shrooms, & Kale. This came with fried mini potatoes and a small, light salad. The potatoes and salad were fresh. But the eggs benny thooooooo... :( . My first qualm was with the English muffin it was on, it ain't toasted which makes it quite difficult to slice with the provided butter knife. Second complaint, that raw kale. I don't get it...why RAW? Imo, lightly sauteed kale with some seasoning would've made this dish much better. Kale doesn't really give you that crunch factor if that was the reasoning for adding it (nor does it really add any flavour). Also , the amount of portabello mushrooms were weak today.

We ordered family style (which is perfect since we were with our kids) and the waiter did an excellent job of suggesting variety and portions that made for a well rounded meal. He suggested we start with this epic pile of salad ingredients called the Singaporean-Style Slaw and it was the perfect start to the meal. Next was the tuna two ways and then the ""LUCKEE"" shrimp cheung fun. Both were delicate, precisely plated and had depth of flavour that both our kids (age 6 and 9) commented how much they liked.

695,Italian place with a burger,"Honestly I can't even think of words to begin this review. This restaurant is simply AMAZING. From the moment I entered, we were treated with incredible service. We arrived 30 minutes early for our reservation, and the manager personally took our drink order to enjoy while we waited for our table. The dim lights and ambience of the place made it easy to relax and enjoy dinner. Its a large plate sharing type of restaurant where a different server brings out each dish and describes it to you. We ordered multiple dishes and they even switched our plates and utensils between each order so as not to mix the flavors! The hostess was pleasant, and service was nothing short of what I would expect at this type of place. 5 stars from me! We ordered a total of 4 dishes to split between 2 people, which was a good amount because we were so hungry! If you're not really hungry, then 2-3 dishes shared between 2 people would be ideal. We of course ordered the 19 ingredient signature Singapore slaw, they bring it out in a huge tray and toss it in front of you - the server even let me take a picture of the salad before he tossed it haha! The salad itself was incredibly satisfying, the dressing was perfectly seasoned and the salad itself was light and refreshing which is surprising for 19 ingredients! We also ordered the goat cheese tarte which was delicious! The third dish was shrimp and lobster ravioli, 8 could honestly eat this ALL DAY LONG! The shrimp itself with the garlic sauce was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. As a shrimp enthusiast, I make sure to always order the shrimp dishes, and this did not disappoint. It was definitely one of the best shrimp dishes I've ever had. Lastly, we ordered the Top Chef Curry Chicken dish which is the winner of top chef. I honestly don't think I've ever had such perfectly cooked chicken, with a crispy thin skin. The chef recommends that you eat each bite of chicken with a piece of grilled pineapple and try the different sauces - mint with a spicy sauce and a coconut curry sauce. Honestly words cannot describe how delectable this dish was, I could eat this every single day of my life and not be bored!Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant and it's experience to EVERYONE, at least once. The one thing I have to add is that it is quite expensive, around $20-$40 per each entrée, so if you're on a budget I recommend trying 1-2 dishes and to make reservations for a special occasion! If not the dishes we ordered, there is definitely something on the menu for everyone!! This place gets 5 Stars from me. I will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu!",83.95246

It also came with a hot stone pot of purple rice which was scooped into our bowls by the server. The server then poured water into the hot stone pot and left it soaking on our tables. I was unsure if there was a purpose or they wanted to grab all the dirty dishes together. Puzzled, we ate with soaking wet rice on our side.The stew was okay, the soup wasn't too rich in flavour. Maybe it was because I didn't ask for it too spicy. It also came with an egg on the side you crack yourself into the stew which is pretty cool. I love rich stew and the soon tofu wasn't the greatest for me. I hope their other dishes have promise and I believe they do based on the number of customers.

That was the last our waiter visited our table!!.After about 20 minutes our food was dropped and it was average at best. The meat was drier than it needed to be, and the fries were OK. After about another 15 mins we picked up our check and paid.The positive from this experience was, we were in and out fast.

I typically come here just for it.Another item that I like is the gyros pizza, which is a personal sized pizza with cheese, vegetables, and meat. It's not greasy at all, which provides a pleasant tasting experience since I'm not a fan of greasy pizza.Sometimes they'll try to bring all the food at the same time, so if you order the pizza for example you will end up waiting a bit longer than others that get gyros or rice dishes.One of those places that's safe to organize a lunch or dinner at, though it can get busy.",88.170845

I was a Ryerson student and I've been walking past this restaurant for over a year but I've never bothered to try it out thinking that it's just a typical pizza place and there are other less fancy pizza places for cheaper price. What got me interested is their Build your own pizza concept with unlimited toppings FREE ($12.85). I don't know any restaurant with this kind of offer and it is a very fair price in this market. When we went on Sunday evening at 6.45pm, there was a line-up to the door and it took us 10-15mins to get to the order-taking/build your pizza station. I chose half classic Tomato sauce and half garlic Pesto sauce with extra mozzarella cheese. The guy putting on the cheese only added a little more when I said extra though and it was a little awkward to ask him more. I then had Smoked Ham, ground beef, red onions, roasted garlic, spinach, green pepper, mushroom and pineapple. They then cook it in an open-fire-blazing oven. Waiting for the pizza to cook took 5-10mins. It didn't seem too long as the person prepping the cooked pizzas were doing his job so fast and it was entertaining/fascinating to watch. I then added barbecue sauce drizzle. Another reason why I love this place is their additional cheese, Tabasco sauce, Sriracha, herb, and chilli flakes available on the side. I am a cheese lover, and I like a little spiciness in my food. I will definitely come back. Food: 5/5Price: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5",88.07312

860,Italian place with a burger,"Walked over an hour to get because a guy in my hostel told me this was the best Indian / Pakistani food in Toronto. I ordered  two of the lamb chicken and beef kabobs , a side of garlic naan and a samosa .The food was spiced and cooked to perfection .  My only qualms with this place are that the Kebabs are on the smaller side and you  can't adjust the heat level since the meat is premarinated. You can add a side of chiilis but it's not the same .  . Whenever you go to an Indian spot and get tandoori items you usually get a green sauce as well as a sweet purple / red sauce .which I got with my kebabs here .With the exception of the raita this place offered the best duping sauces I've ever.I highly recommend you check this place out if you're planning to visit Toronto and have a hankering for Indian .I'll definitely be back .",90.99094

865,Italian place with a burger,Best naan anywhere. Do not go without ordering their naan!!We absolutely love their butter chicken. Our classic order is two butter naan with the butter chicken and this is the right amount for two people without overdoing it. I've only taken one star off because we would love to order the rice but it's so blinking expensive (even though they do give you a lot - better value for 4 people and still enough rice). The chicken and beef kebabs are quite good as well. We never begrudge ordering a kebab or two if we go in extra hungry!,77.33894

880,Italian place with a burger,"Fishman lobster clubhouse is a must visit when in Toronto for seafood lovers. The restaurant walls are encased with tanks of lobsters, king crabs, Dungeness crabs...you name it. Our party of 8 ordered the pre fix family style meal (item #G) which says for 6-7 ppl, but it was definitely more than enough food to feed all of us. We ended up with a party tray of leftovers. They start you off with soup followed by deep fried large oysters in sauce, king crab/ lobster towers, fish, pea shoots, and lobster roe fried rice. There's also dessert!The stellar items from our meal was of course the king crab (6lb) and lobster (7lb) towers. Both were prepared in similar ways. The king crab (HK style) was deliciously coated in a blend of seasonings that included a light mix of sweetness, tanginess, and savoriness with a bit of a kick but not spicy. The fries that surround the king crab tower are what you've never had elsewhere. It beats your local McDonald's or Burger King any day. Covered in the same seasoning, the fries are so addicting and will have you reaching for more without realizing it. The lobster with dried garlic is so plump and juicy. Coated in the same light batter, it was similar in taste to that of the king crab but without the sweet and tangy flavor. If you think the lobster meat is a bit bland, just coat it with the dried garlic to add extra crunch and taste! By the end of our meal, we were waddling out of the restaurant. The price is unbeatable for the quality. The amount paid per person was just as much as what we might have paid for just an entree with drinks at a restaurant in NYC. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in town!",87.81047

Not only did we look this place up and saw that it had great reviews but my friend also recommended this place to us on the list places to eat at Toronto. Was able to call the day of for reservations for 3 and they had a 7pm opening. I recommend you make reservations because this place get packed! Parking was fine when we got there but was crazy when we were leaving. I can tell that besides families, a lot of big groups (10+ people) come here too. For the 3 of us, we got course E. And we loved every little bit of it. Side note: the pricing they have on the menu is more or less what you will pay. Depending on the size/weight of lobster/crab they have, the pricing can change a bit. But your server will come over to your table (with the live lobster and crab) and show you the price difference you'll be paying. And at that point you can decide if it's okay or not. Every dish was so sooo so good. The meat on the crab and lobster was juicy and flavorful. Can't complain. And the portion size is HUGE so most tables definitely had to go trays (yes, trays) and boxes. **No credit cards accepted! So for all you visitors (like us) make sure you have CA$H on you!!! They will take American dollars**Overall the service was fine. Everyone who we spoke to were friendly. They did forget about us for a moment and forgot to bring out the fried rice to us.

895,Italian place with a burger,"Fishman Lobster Clubhouse is our go-to place whenever we want to impress guests from overseas. This is because in Asia, imported lobster can cost an arm and a leg. A heaping mountain of fresh lobster meat is still impressive every time when we see it arrive on the table!The menu has multiple combo options that of course revolve around lobster or king crab. Meal price is based on weight of the seafood, and the live lobster is brought to you for inspection before it is prepared. Within a short time, the huge lobster mountain will arrive, assuming that's the style that you ordered.

The food quality is great- expect fresh sashimi and a lot of yummy sushi rolls. I really enjoyed the special which was eel with gold flakes. Ou- also the mango slush was sooo good, it was more like an actual drink instead of a dessert. Service was average- nothing out of the blue. The atmosphere was modern and clean!

940,Italian place with a burger,"Came here for lunch with a few coworkers, randomly chose a spot to eat so there was no expectations for this place. The inside was a bit on the rundown side, typical Chinatown restaurant. The decoration and atmosphere resembled most pho places. Everyone ordered pho, nothing complicated and pretty standard.

985,Italian place with a burger,"After one failed attempt, we finally made it in to give Pai a try. The first time, it was lunchtime on a weekday and two sleeping toddlers in strollers. There was no ramp/elevator so we had to choose a different location if we wanted to have a peaceful lunch (which we did end up having elsewhere). We had tickets to the Royal Alexandra Theatre and thought that this would be the perfect time for a second attempt. As we passed by at 5:25pm, we noticed the line up already out the door. I ended up jumping out of the car while hubby went to look for parking. There's a line to get a buzzer and I was pleasantly surprised when I got to the host desk that it would only be a 15-20min wait. Although it looks small, the restaurant is actually quite large and can seat lots of people. We ended up eating about 20 minutes and was led to the back area. We passed a couple of ""traditional"" mat-on-floor type raised seating. The decor reminded me of a street food type setting. The menu is in Thai so I needed to read the translated explanations. When we were waiting I saw a bunch of mango sticky rices pass by so I knew I wanted to leave room for those. We bypassed the appies and got a Pad Thai (I wanted to compare with Royal Orchid and one in Grand Cayman which is so far the BEST tasting Pad Thai I've had), and a green curry with chicken served in a young coconut. We also got two iced teas. When I asked if they came pre-sweetened, I should've asked if the level of sweetness could be customized since other places typically make it too sweet for my liking. This one was just that. I'll have to ask next time around if we come back. We found that the wait was a bit long... over 15 minutes for the food to come out.  The Pad Thai was served with grated cabbage just like the Caymans so I was excited. The tamarind sauce was sweet, like Royal Orchid's but didn't have that savory flavour like the one in the Caymans (good thing we are going back! Can't wait!!!). So flavour was ok but the noodles were complete stuck together in a mass. Maybe too soft? Not enough oil?  I don't know. The green curry was nice and anything they couldn't fit into the coconut was served in a separate bowl. Mango sticky rice came nicely carved and on regular sticky rice. I've had ones served on purple sticky rice which gives it a nice texture. Flavour wise it was good but a bit skimpy on the mango. This dish was quite small for the $10 price tag. All-in-all, I'd say it's an average Thai restaurant. I wouldn't drive downtown and wait in line when I could have the same quality food uptown without lineups and free parking.",84.830086

The idea of noodles and broth has never struck me as particularly exciting.

It delivers on the unique qualities of a great ramen  - rich, flavourful broth, succulent noodles, the right combination of garlic/salt/spice - but then elevates the whole experience with an inventiveness only a great and passionate chef could muster. I got the Red Dragon. Besides ticking all the box's I just mentioned, it also had this mild sweetness to it. I generally don't like much sweetness in a savoury dish, but this somehow pulled everything together really nicely, almost as thought the ingredients were naturally sweet. I doubt no sugar was added, but the point is that it worked. Really, really well. The pork itself was lovely. I'm not a big pork guy, but the flavour of the meat wasn't at all aggressive which I appreciated. The sprouts added an awesome crunch, along with the peanuts. Loved the chilli flake oil on top as well. The dish itself was also really beautifully presented. I wasn't starving going in, but got hungry the moment I was served. Finally, it's worth pointing out that the Red Dragon isn't exactly cheap - it came to just over $20 after tax and tip, so high for ramen.

1075,Italian place with a burger,"Stopped in for a late night bite. Yum! The place was packed but good turnover so no wait time. They offer  $40pp sampling menu but we decided to go à la carte. Started with 2 bowls of MISO SHIRU (miso soup, $3.50) which was flavourful but a bit too heavy on the bonito for my taste.  The TAKOWASABI ($5.30) was cool-spicy-deliciousness: chopped tender octopus in biting wasabi served slightly chilled, a great starter or snack with drinks.  First hot dish was the KAKIMAYO ($9.30), baked oysters with spinach, mushrooms, garlic mayo and cheese. I think we found 4 tiny oysters total in the dish but it was still super delicious. They should really offer a vegetarian version with all mushrooms and no oyster at all.  Next we had the highly recommended BRIE CHEESE ($8.90). I was sceptical and happily proven wrong. Gooey warm brie deep fried in a crisp golden crust served over not-too-sweet mango and berry coulis. Wow. In retrospect, it's deep fried cheese... how can that go wrong?  Then came the meat. KARUBI ($9.9) a tiny plate of bland, sad-looking, cardboard-thin beef ribs served with a bowl of oil. We were expecting something salty-sweet & charred like Korean galbi, but alas thiskarubi dish was a disaster. After the first bite I declined to eat any more, it was so disappointing.Finally the TONTORO ($8.50) grilled pork cheek skewer. Worst pork cheek I've ever had. Tough and chewy. When is cheek meat ever chewy??   I can't even.To drink: OOLONG HIGH ($8.30) vodka & oolong tea over ice. Cool and refreshing in all the right ways and no sugar!!! Loved every drop.The ambiance was loud and rowdy as expected; lots of fun. Service was great at the beginning but slowed down exponentially with each dish. Frozen grapes served with the bill are a great touch. Would definitely go back again but stick to seafood and veg. Meat is NOT their forte.",86.20586

Server was friendly and introduced certain items and drinks. If you're going for the Kinkalicious event, it requires a minimum of two orders (29/person). It was a 7 course meal so here goes.....Sashimi sampler: My fav - lobster tail, salmon and scallop. Was nice, cold and fresh. Seaweed & tofu salad: Light and not too saucy. Fry plate (karage & takoyaki): didn't try the takoyaki, but karage was fried nicely and had a good crunchGrilled pork cheek skewers: A bit chewy for me, but the taste was decent. Baked oysters: Nice and cheesy! Had potatoes mixed in as well which complemented well. Mushroom & Cheese bibimbap: Was quite big considering the size of the other dishes, more toppings would have been nice.Matcha ice cream: nothing too special, but at least its a dessert! Service: expected the almost non stop shouting and enthusiasm, did not expect to be that rushed for time.

Server was friendly and introduced certain items and drinks. If you're going for the Kinkalicious event, it requires a minimum of two orders (29/person). It was a 7 course meal so here goes.....Sashimi sampler: My fav - lobster tail, salmon and scallop. Was nice, cold and fresh. Seaweed & tofu salad: Light and not too saucy. Fry plate (karage & takoyaki): didn't try the takoyaki, but karage was fried nicely and had a good crunchGrilled pork cheek skewers: A bit chewy for me, but the taste was decent.

1155,Italian place with a burger,"I came here the other day for a quick bite and the weather wasn't very nice - very rainy in fact, but i stopped by for a quick coffee and some appetizers. They have two sections - one for dine-in, and one for grab and go. Becuase I wasn't staying long, I went to the grab and go section. I ordered a Cortado and their GRIDDLED FISH ""BANNACOS"" - recommended by the girl who was serving me at the counter :) it did not disappoint!The fish tacos were presented beautifully along with a apple cucumber salad :) the fish was nice and crispy, and the seasoning and garnishes with the taco was excellent! They used a bit more sour cream than i would like, but all in all the tacos were very tasty and i love the presentation of the apple cucumber salad on a lettuce leaf :) I was also surprised by the coffee! I didn't think it would be a place where i instantly would think great coffee, but they cortado was great! the expresso was done very well, lots of foam and I enjoyed my drink very much. The only hiccup was i forgot to tell the girl i'm lactose intolerant, so it was done with regular milk... but I did take my enzyme pills so all in all it wasn't too bad :) But next time I deifnitely will make a mental note to ask for lactose free milk!I definitely would consider coming back here to try some of their other dishes.

Bannock serves up what cold Canadians are looking for in a meal. On this occasion I was craving a greasy meal after a long day at work. The cheeseburger immediately jumped off the menu and I just had to have it. The burger is accompanied by Taro chips, but I swapped them for fries, which were perfectly crispy.I'll start by saying that the meat they used for the burger was juicy and delicious. It's unfortunate that they hid the taste of the beef with 6 pieces of lettuce and a sauce that I couldn't figure out. Tip: take off the top bun and the lettuce and taste the beef on its own. You'll continue to want to eat this burger with a fork and knife.I love bannock and many things on their menu. On my next visit, I have to try the raved about duck poutine pizza.

It's a comfort meal that costs under $8, so if you like udon and curry, this is a must order!For appetizers, I normally get their tofu nuggets. They're brushed with a sweet and sour sauce and packed with edamame and carrots for an awesome change up in texture. If you're thinking of getting a dessert, I would definitely say go for it.

The server was cute and efficient but they move fast so dont expect 5 star service. But that's not why you go here. Think Japanese street food in a sit down setting.

1185,Italian place with a burger,"I came here last year and have been meaning to go back ever since. We tried the vegetable curry udon, the manpuku ramen (chicken broth with beef), and the wasabi octopus. Both the noodle dishes were delicious and great portions for the price. The octopus on the other hand was very small and tasted just like a wad of wasabi. Overall good place to go for a noodle lunch, but it seems like their small side dishes are not as worth it. I also appreciated their complimentary hot tea. Will be going back again some time to have their takoyaki.",84.2372

1195,Italian place with a burger,"Today was my first time going to this place. Before today, I have never heard of this place until a friend who went to the university across the street brought me there. The restaurant was small as it was tucked in a corner inside a food court. I noticed the menu only had donburi, udon, and some appetizers. We were seated quickly. The waitress were Japanese, so immediately I knew my udon would be more authentic compare to other Japanese udon place. We both ordered udon, with mine the Kitsune udon and hers the Kake udon. We also ordered some appetizers- takoyaki and yakionigiri (pan fried onigiri).The Kitsune udon didn't have much toppings, only a big piece of inari (sweet tofu skin), and two slices of Japanese fish cake. The portion of the udon was small, but the soup was tasty. The udon was cooked perfectly. However, the takoyaki... Well... let's just say I have had better ones. The ones at this restaurant were big, but don't get fooled by the look. It was 90% dough, 10% octopus. The yakionigiri... I don't know... It's salty on the outside, like they pan fried it with soy sauce. I personally not a fan of it. Overall, the food was not bad, but the price was CHEAP!! It's only around $5 for a bowl of udon. I will definitely recommend it if you are around the area and looking for CHEAP and TASTY Japanese udon.",86.54288

1215,Italian place with a burger,"""oh my goodness... this is the best sangria ever!""What time we arrived/Wait time?I made a reservation at 2:45pm on a Tuesday so we we did not have a wait time nor was the restaurant too busy at that time. The restaurant filled up almost completely by the time we left which was around 4:30pm. I was recommended this place by a co-worker because it is her go-to spot. She told me that if I HAD to go to the rooftop patio or else there was no point in going! So I made to sure to call ahead and request a spot on the patio. They told me that they only take requests in case of weather complications. It also seems like Cactus Club is composed of 3 different restaurants - each being on a different floor!Atmosphere?I absolutely was blown away by the interior of the rooftop. It is so so beautiful and such a fun environment. The music wasn't too loud either. There were fun couch seats around the edge, but we did not get seated there (I think those are for bigger groups). There are sheer, white curtains that I believe you can close if you wanted more privacy... it made the place look more like a resort and added a poise vibe.Service/Staff?It seemed as if all the servers were women. They weren't the friendliest but everything was brought to us in a timely manner so I have no real complaints. Food/Menu?The menu is a simple two pager which I like because when there are too many options then it gets really confusing for me to choose. For drinks- we started with the ""rose sangria"" and a ""signature sangria"". They both had sprite in them which made them fizzy and the flavours were AMAZING! We said they both tasted similar to slushies but the signature sangria was much better so get the one for sure!!!I have tried SO many sangrias in my life and that one in particular was very high up there. For mains - she recommended the chicken creole and the poke bowl so we each got that. The poke bowl was very fresh with the mangoes and salmon, and the chicken creole with asparagus/mashed potatoes was really tasty and simple. It was the perfect portion. Overall we loved loved loved this place and would totally go back!Would be so much for a night out for a friends birthday or even for a nice lunch.",82.25409

We said they both tasted similar to slushies but the signature sangria was much better so get the one for sure!!!I have tried SO many sangrias in my life and that one in particular was very high up there.

The poke bowl was very fresh with the mangoes and salmon, and the chicken creole with asparagus/mashed potatoes was really tasty and simple. It was the perfect portion.

The restaurant filled up almost completely by the time we left which was around 4:30pm. I was recommended this place by a co-worker because it is her go-to spot. She told me that if I HAD to go to the rooftop patio or else there was no point in going! So I made to sure to call ahead and request a spot on the patio. They told me that they only take requests in case of weather complications. It also seems like Cactus Club is composed of 3 different restaurants - each being on a different floor!Atmosphere?I absolutely was blown away by the interior of the rooftop. It is so so beautiful and such a fun environment. The music wasn't too loud either. There were fun couch seats around the edge, but we did not get seated there (I think those are for bigger groups). There are sheer, white curtains that I believe you can close if you wanted more privacy... it made the place look more like a resort and added a poise vibe.Service/Staff?It seemed as if all the servers were women. They weren't the friendliest but everything was brought to us in a timely manner so I have no real complaints.

1220,Italian place with a burger,"Portions are super generous. My friend and I came here for a work lunch and shared the truffle fries. I got the grilled chicken modern bowl which came with Jasmine rice, salad, mango salsa, cous cous. My friend was craving the lettuce wraps since she had it two weeks ago at the Sherway Garden mall location. It was very delicious and very filling for an appetizer. If you were going to come in a group of 4 or more, the lettuce wraps appetizer alone will fill you up! Truffle fries were amazing as well, light truffle oil which I assumed were used and the dipping sauce which I believe was horseradish was a good side. We sat on the roof top level and they had the heaters on since it was cold out. Very nice and cozy. Overall, great atmosphere and good food!",88.29051

1235,Italian place with a burger,"This is a super belated review, as I came here last year at around Christmas time. I didn't have Yelp at that time, and only stumbled upon my photos now!Came here after visiting the Christmas market, and was very excited to slurp down some hot noodles and soup. We started off with some green tea, which was nicely packaged in mason jars (so hipster) - careful though, as they cost extra!We then ordered an appetizer of tako wasabi to share. This was my first time trying, and I loved it! It was delicious. We also got a side of takoyaki, which was decent. It definitely was quite soggy and the flavour fell flat. Nothing like what you'd get in Osaka, but I obviously can't compare Canadian standards to authentic Japanese cuisine!I ordered the original pork ramen, as I've heard it's what Kinton is famous for. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed by the end result! The chashu, unlike what it should be, was literally pure fat. Although that may appeal to some people, I didn't find it to be the best companion to the meal. The broth was bone white, but for some reason, I found that it really did lack depth of flavour. It was fatty, for sure, but I've made ramen broth at home, and I really do think it was missing that collagen. I've had better broth at smaller ramen joints, and perhaps Kinton is just too large a franchise/business to really put as much effort into its broth anymore.Overall, it was okay, but would likely not return just for its ramen.",87.01105

1245,Italian place with a burger,"First time visiting Kinton although I have tried all the other ramen places in TO.  No wait at 12:45pm.  Our group was greeted very quickly to the bar in front of the kitchen.Very efficient and friendly service.  Food came quickly.  Spicy garlic ramen was delicious.  Only disappointment was that it did not come with egg or seawood.  Pork miso was very good as well.Waitress was very friendly.  Informed us about the instagram dessert freebie and that I can put my bag under the stool.  For the freebie, we had the roasted green tea pudding.  Adequate portion but since it's free, no complaints.  A refreshing way to end a meal on a summer day.Would definitely visit again.  Especially the location in richmond hill.",85.15522
