10,Italian place,"Not sure why, but the shoyu broth and noodle here is way better than the Santouka in Vancouver. The pork jowl is absolutely delicious, but they're set aside for a reason. Don't put it all into your broth immediately (my noob mistake), or the first few pieces might taste delicious, but the rest will be overly tough while it's slowly cooked in the ramen broth. The aji tamago I added on the side was average at best (Over cooked and under seasoned? Marinated? ) ~$28 for the ramen + egg + cold tea... so decent pricing. I didn't like how they rushed you with the bill though when you're still working on your meal though. I did enjoy how they had a bar counter for the solo diners and the communal tables for the group diners though. Overall, a solid 4 star.",77.25043

20,Italian place,"It should come to no surprise that I am a huge ramen fan. I had some truly amazing ramen in Japan and have felt ramen-withdrawal since then. There are some good ramen spots in New York City, but none of them serve tsukemen, which is one of my absolute favorite finds in Tokyo. Tsukemen, or dipping ramen, features cold, al dente ramen noodles that you dip into a hot broth, which is served on the side. When I found out that HRS served it, it went onto the calendar. BF had never had them before, so it was a first for him. I felt like I hyped it up so much beforehand. Thankfully, I think it lived up to the hype for him! We arrived around 6:15pm and had a 10-15 minute wait. We were the last couple in through the door before they required everyone else to start a line outside. It got very long by the time we left. I opted to start with a melon soda float, which the BF was skeptical of at first, but really enjoyed. I think he might have been his favorite part of dinner! We both ordered their non-spicy tsukemen and it was glorious - perfect al dente noodles with a tasty, hot broth on the side. I wish the broth was a little bit thicker so it would stick more, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Quick tip for my fellow US travelers, they don't take Amex.",82.846016

30,Italian place,"WHAT TO TRY?!Their ramen!! Personally, liked their shio ramen the best because it has a rich creamy broth that is not like other ramen places. Can really taste the milky cream texture of the pork broth. Each bowl will come with two slices or pork so if you don't think that's enough, you can order the bigger portion sized one where they give you five slices of pork. They are really quick to serve your noodles shortly after you order. So don't worry about the lines! Because mean comes out very quickly!LAST TIP?! This place doesn't serve chicken or beef so they mainly only have pork broths and pork slices!! The vegetable ramen is on their secret menu in the kitchen so that's the only other ramen that doesn't have meat. And the portion size relative to Kenzo is smaller because the bowls are smaller.

They are really quick to serve your noodles shortly after you order. So don't worry about the lines! Because mean comes out very quickly!LAST TIP?! This place doesn't serve chicken or beef so they mainly only have pork broths and pork slices!! The vegetable ramen is on their secret menu in the kitchen so that's the only other ramen that doesn't have meat. And the portion size relative to Kenzo is smaller because the bowls are smaller. The prices are also more expensive than Kenzo so be aware!",84.51213
40,Italian place,Came here on a Sunday at around 6pm and there was a short line up. We (partay of 2) waited for around 15 min with maybe 4 groups ahead of us which wasnt bad.. but when we came back out the line was like 3 times as long...I got the shio ramen which was really good! Broth was creamy (but I've had creamier) and the noodles were nice and chewy. So far prob one of the best ramens I've had in Toronto. Only thing I didn't like was the meat. It came with two pieces.. one was fatty which was good but the other piece was a bit too tough for my liking.,78.53385

50,Italian place,"3.5 stars... service and craft beer variety is a 4 star.  The food... it had some gaps sadly.  Those duck fat & beef tallow fries ... Amaaaazing.  Beer bistro has been known to be for a while.  If you think the craft beer halls is all new, you need to know that Beer Bistro has been around 10 years and serving up craft beers from around the world since then.  Ground zero would be here.  The space is quite large with a huge vaulted ceilings and a large patio off to the side.  I would say it reminds me of a nice upscale bar.  Casual but not your neighbourhood spot.  There is a bar area with a few large big screens.  So if your date is wanting to watch the hockey game and pepper you non stop with questions, you got your spot.  There is also an open kitchen into the dining room so you can watch your food being created.Service here is great... on point, always available, and pleasant.  They're incredibly well informed on the many beers that is found in their encyclopedia.  She was able to help tell us which beers wouldnt be our favourite knowing that what we liked.  They always checked in on us and kept our smaller table clean of used plates.As for their beers... good god, the book was insanely long but thankfully detailed in highlighting key tasting notes.  I loved how they have many different types locally but also internationally.  I also really liked how a lot of these craft beer were so affordable... none of these crazy $14 per glass for a Toronto craft beer.  Rather we found good Collective Arts ones for only $7.50.  I love this and I hope they continue this.Hog wild flat bread - You can smell the bacon and bbq sauce as it passes your table.  Thats what made us order this one.  It's a nice size for an app... good to share among a few people.  The taste was ok... the bbq was a typical sweet sauce with not a lot of zing or flavour.  The meat on it was a touch dry and not sure cause it was dried out in the oven.  The base was really dry and with no flavour.  It was more like a dried out biscuit.  It's decent bar food.  3/5Truffled potato pierogies - Another shareable app with crisped up pierogies with a few toppings.  The inside of the pierogies was a lot but not a lot of flavour.  It was just a lot of mashed unsalted potatoes.  I didn't taste any truffles or mushroom flavours through the dish.  Visually it was appealing but not sure if there was more to it.  3/5Spicy Red Thai mussels - A generous cast iron pot arrives to your plate and it's filled with plump and hot mussels.  Not a single one was closed or had broken shells.  That was very good to see.  There was enough broth on the bottom to soak up the sauce but for the beginning, it was so hard to try to get the top mussels any flavour because you couldnt just dig down to the bottom easily.  It would have been great if they could toss all the mussels into the sauce before serving.  First world problems.  Maybe Spicy Red Thai was the wrong flavour to get but this was not spicy... I wouldnt even say it was mild or even Thai.  No ginger, galangal, or spices that reminded me of Thai mussels I had at Kiin.  So maybe go for the other broths instead.  3.5/5Belgian Frites - THIS... is what you come for.  The beef tallow and duck fat fries are just so good.  Possibly one of my favourite in Toronto so far.  Tried Wvrst and Bellwoods which are considered other top Toronto fries and Beer Bistro is the clear winner.  Every fry is super hot, crispy, doused in salt, and nicely bronzed.  This was just well executed and they give you a huge cone of it!  Just delicious... Beer and Fries at Beer Bistro.  Hell ya.  I didnt even use the sauces they gave me cause it tasted good on its own.  4.5/5Not sure if the kitchen was off that day but clearly they got some things done well.  Those fries are amazing.  I have to give credit to the staff... just attentive service from a bar is always good to me.  Definitely a good spot to try a variety of beers without feeling the hipster judgement.",80.83472

80,Italian place,"My boyfriend and I dined here on a weekend for lunch. The restaurant serves their brunch menu until 3pm, so we took advantage and ordered $3 beer mimosas. You can't go wrong with mimosas. The staff are well educated on their beer offerings and the food. We had great service from the beginning of our meal to the moment we left.We ordered a large bistro salad, the fries, and the spicy red Thai muscles. The salad was perfect to share, it had a good dressing and variety of veggies. With no protein, I probably wouldn't order this as a main. The Belgian frites were phenomenal. Blanched in beef tallow and duck fat, and served with house made mayo, they were probably some of the best fries I've ever had. Perfectly crunchy, salty and very flavourful on their own. The muscles were cooked in a flavourful broth with peppers and onions. They were tender and a little spicy and came with sourdough for dipping. If I dined here again, I would have a very difficult time ordering something else off the menu. I loved each dish we tried and would highly recommend them!",80.69916

Their crepes are so thick that resembles a pita bread indeed. They have a lot of fillings, I guess that's what many people like.BUT that's it! Nothing really creative or requires any special skills what so ever. Even their choice of fillings are sooooo generic like a Subway has.I would say this is more of a Pita Pit/Subway kind of food, is it even better than that? I would not think so. I am so surprised that how a place like this is so highly rated?!?! ‍Torontonians have an urgent need to be exposed to some real good food...man...That said, go for it if your are starving though.

150,Italian place,"Preface: this review is for the dinner experience, NOT the dim sum experience (which isn't offered in the evenings).When we first walked in, we noticed two things. First, the decorations. The whole restaurant is covered in gold and white cloth, from the floor to the chairs to the tables. The servers are all wearing fancy suits, and there's even a wall with a ton of wine bottles. It's not fancy like a steakhouse, but it looks nice, rather than faux-fancy. And second, we noticed the seafood tanks! You can observe the live seafood swimming and crawling around, including king crabs, lobsters, fish, shrimp, and geoduck (one of the largest edible clams!). They were all a lot of fun to watch.Once we got to our table, we were presented with a challenge: navigating the menu. There are TWO menus, each containing well over 100 items, and many of them don't have clear prices. On top of that, some of the items were only in Chinese. If you're not Chinese yourself, figuring out what to order can be quite complicated. We asked for advice from our server, but that didn't help us narrow down - it just left us with even more options. It seemed like some of the dishes were more authentic, whereas others were more ""tourist-friendly."" We ended up getting the ""dinner for 4"" (the one with BBQ pork, since there are two different ""dinners for 4"" - one per menu), plus some fresh scallops.The dinner came with multiple different dishes which we shared family-style. Some of them were great, such as the soup, the BBQ pork (which was the highlight), and the stir-fried shrimp. Some were just ok, such as the scallops and the fish. Others were disappointing, such as the bok choy and the dessert. I think there's a bit of a learning curve - you need to figure out what's good (and what you like) in order to maximize your enjoyment.Overall, the meal was certainly unique, and on the whole we had a good time.

Like I said - Super-sized!The dishes I feel is a little subpar are- Fried shrimp ball with almonds - this is nothing like any fried shrimp ball from other places. I thought it would be similar, just different coating, but its not to my liking, it doesn't have enough shrimp flavour.- the octopus tentacles (SP) - not crispy enough, some were even chewy. - the fried sticky pork dumpling - dough ratio to filling is a little thick. Also it was not hot nor crispy on the outside.I have no complaints on the service despite them being busy. We were able to get additional hot sauces and hot water  as our need arise.",74.70036

The food was great! I wouldn't say it was the best Dim Sum I've ever had but it's hard to compare. The thing we liked best was the uniqueness of some of the dishes. Most of the Dim Sum places around my hometown serve similar items to other cities we've been to like in L.A. or N.Y.C., almost cookie-cutter Dim Sum. But this place had a lot of different and new dishes that we had never seen before. Presentation (food and plating) was nice and everything tasted delicious. We got there at about 2pm on a weekday and it was still busy. I think it remained packed during the time we were there but it seems the staff was used to it. I think if you're going to try this place you have to come with the expectation that you're gonna get good food at a slight hassle (slow service and long wait times).",83.11654

200,Italian place,My absolute favourite restaurant in Toronto. It could definitely get expensive if you're a big eater but it's so worth trying for a special occasion.Their nigiri sushi and jabistro rolls are good but the absolute must orders are the aburi/pressed sushi selection.

Although pricey and on the higher end of restaurants, this place is worth every buck. Came here for my birthday last weekend and we loved it! The waiter was very patient as it was our first time and we weren't sure what to order. We ended up with favourites that were recommended by our waiter. Started with the hakkaido salad and sashimi platter to share and each got our own kyukyoku and aburi. Note: should've shared the kyukyoku and aburi as well; having our own was way too much food (although we did finish it all). All 4 dishes were amazing! Great presentation and variety. The sashimi melted like butter in our mouths. Did I mention this place was worth every buck? Our dessert was the creme brûlée and green tea ice cream. As the biggest creme brûlée enthusiast, this made it to my top creme brulees in the city! Loved it! JaBistro does their version for winterlicious and summerlicious twice a year. Where you can get 5 courses for $77. Although we didn't do that this time around, would love to come back and try that. Overall, 5 stars for this restaurant!",82.93967

The sashimi melted like butter in our mouths. Did I mention this place was worth every buck? Our dessert was the creme brûlée and green tea ice cream. As the biggest creme brûlée enthusiast, this made it to my top creme brulees in the city! Loved it! JaBistro does their version for winterlicious and summerlicious twice a year. Where you can get 5 courses for $77. Although we didn't do that this time around, would love to come back and try that. Overall, 5 stars for this restaurant!",88.25525

The pan fried dumplings do have a bit more saltiness and flavour but I just love a good boiled dumpling! The green beans were just amazing salty goodness! The chines broccoli was a bit bland. Most places will make them super garlicky, salty and greasy... here there was barely any garlic, so it tasted a bit more bland, but probably healthier that way anyway.

310,Italian place,"I love Kastu, it's such a basic concept. You get a thin slice of meat and then you coat it in egg wash then coat it in breadcrumbs before you fry it. I love doing it at home so part of me wondered how good can Fat Ninja Bite's Katsu be? Well it's amazing! Their Katsu is just the flakiest yet light and crispy. It's crazy delicious.We went and tried their sandwich with the chicken Katsu in dark meat and the pork Don Katsu with rice. I'll tell you now that the sandwich was a clear 5/5 while the rice was 4/5. The sandwich has so many components to it and together was more hormonious.  I also preferred the chicken over the pork. Even though the pork was indeed tender, the chicken was juicier and a lighter chew worked better. The sandwich had tomatoes, lettuce, slaw, and even pickles, brought together by a nice spicy mayo. As you've seen the cutlet itself, is way bigger than the bun itself, we ate the second cutlet on it's own. What I really liked was their sauce. It's sweet and slightly tangy. It resembles something of a teriyaki sauce and it's excellent. The rice plate was more ordinary and just featured the Katsu with rice and slaw. Again, you get two cutlets, and there's a ton of food here. The slaw is pretty ordinary, it would be interesting if FNB offered a more traditional thinly sliced and lightly dressed cabbage slaw instead a mayo based one.",77.20445

The chicken was very tender and moist with a hint of truffle oil - served on top of a bed of roasted potatoes and carrots that nicely soaked up the roasting pans juices. The hanger steak was cooked to my liking - medium rare. The herb butter and the au jus that came with it was a match in heaven. The blend of herbs and seasoning they use on their skinny fries was very unique and tasty.I would definitely recommend this place.,78.71629

400,Italian place,"Visited this Toronto famous pizzeria a few weekends ago during their down time around 3ish on a Sunday. I know there are a few around the city but wanted to try the original.The staff was nice and we got a table by their front open window which had a nice breeze and gorgeous view of their restaurant. We ordered their arancini and nduja sausage pizza, the arancini was crispy on the outside, warm and gooey on the inside with amazing tomato sauce to top it all with. Fresh and still making my mouth water now. The pizza on the other hand was disappointing... the dough in the middle was soggy and seemed a bit underdone. The cheesy which I wished was gooey was very watery, which explains the sogginess.

Enormous thick slices of Beefsteak tomatoes inter cut with small thin slices of bocconcini. The ratio was off. The markup on the ingredients is assinine - from roughly 80 cents for the tomato and $1 for the bocconcini used to over $10. Very little olive oil, basil. No salt, pepper, oregano or dried seasoning of any sort. This menu item deserves better. This is Chef Boyardee in its overall presentation. The dough/crust on the 2 pizza was delightful - top quality. Didn't love the sauce, absolutely missing key spices and/or some salt. Objectively speaking the cheese is sub par.

Served on house made labneh.Mushroom pita/12 hour braised lamb and kale, black bean and lentil rice were all thoroughly enjoyed as well!Middle Eastern Fried Chicken, family really enjoyed this they said it was crispy on the outside and the hot sauce and tahini added tons of flavour. Grilled whole branzino was light, flakey and delicious.For dessert we tried the Loukoumades (honey balls) which were light and so delicately sweet, and the Pavlova which was such a nice treat when the meringue was cracked open. My mom tried and loved the rose's shadow which was Pomegranate, lemon juice, rose water, and hibiscus.The service was attentive and consistent, top notch!My only complaint was that it was uncomfortably warm upstairs throughout the meal. but won't deter me from returning :)",84.347626

490,Italian place,"An absolutely exquisite meal! Came here with a party of three... Although my expectations were high coming into the restaurant, the food still well exceeded my standards. I was completely blown away! We reserved our table well in advance (a month ago), so this was a long awaited meal.The waitress told us that the style of Byblos is sharing plates, and that roughly 6 plates would be needed to serve the three of us. Naively, we told her that since we had small appetites, we shouldn't need six plates. Little did we know... The food was so addicting, and the portions were fairly small, leading us to order round after round after round.We started off with a couple appetizers, outlined below.Turkish Manti Dumplings:I've heard so many different things about this dish - some people love it, others find it too bland. We loved it! The flavours were super complex; although being completely vegetarian, it didn't taste it at all. The eggplant had a rich smokey flavour that accentuated the dish. The creamy halloumi and tangy yogurt balanced the salty flavour of the eggplant. I didn't really taste the sweetness of the molasses, and really enjoyed the crisp dumpling surface contrasted with the creamy sauce. Fig Salad:The first and foremost flavour that jumps out at you when eating this salad is the floral taste, stemming from the orange blossom vinaigrette. The tangy vinegar had a very delicate blossom undertone; I could truly taste the fragrance and perfume of the orange blossom. The figs added a nice touch of sweetness; however, there were very little pieces. When we brought that up to the waitress, she was kind enough to accommodate and brought us a dish of a fresh fig cut up. The fig was delightfully fresh! I liked this salad - however, given its high price point, it was a small portion with few ingredients.For the mains, we had a variety of different dishes such as the following.Tah-Dig:This is a classic Mediterranean dish with crispy rice, and surprisingly small for its ingredients and price (I think I'm seeing a trend). That said, the rice was addicting crispy and delicious! The lamb was braised to be fall apart tender, and the warm figs highlighted and lightened the meal. The nuts were a nice addition. Grilled Whole Banzino:This was by far my favourite dish of the entire meal! It was my first time having chermoullah, a pesto-like savoury salty sauce. The parsley and cilantro green dressing with the lemon juice really lightened up the grilled fish. The skin was also the right amount of crisp. I was amazed by this dish, and ate every single last piece.Ora King Salmon:We didn't have enough, and so ordered this additional protein. The four pieces of salmon were grilled to a perfect char, rendering the skin crispy. Meanwhile, the salmon was cooked just right - the inside was moist and tender. It was the perfect pink, and by no means dry. The harissa sauce was a lovely spicy addition. Though good, it didn't stand up to the banzino for me.Crispy Hand Rolled Couscous:This dish was very similar to the Tah-Dig in that it was likewise crispy. That said, I enjoyed this dish so much more! The creamy halloumi with the collard greens was absolutely delicious. I'm not a fan of cheese, but this and the Manti Dumplings really won me over.We ended the meal with a dessert. We couldn't decide between the baklava and pavlova (both executed in fusion style), but the waitress recommended the baklava.Stuffed Baklava:This dish had mint ice cream stuffed inside crispy pastry (similar to a cannoli), sprinkled with pistachios and topped with a dark chocolate mousse. It was an interesting mix and juxtaposition of flavours and textures - the crisp of the pastry and pistachio contrasted with the creamy mousse/chocolate and ice cream. The sweetness of the dark chocolate and ice cream was cut by the sudden addition of sea salt. To be honest, this dessert wasn't my favourite as the salt caught me off guard. However, I did enjoy the dark chocolate and pistachios. Most certainly an interesting dessert style.This place is quite pricey, so save up! Moreover, come with a larger group to both split the cost and share more things. Next time, I will definitely try the pavlova (the table next to us seemed to thoroughly enjoy it) and the sweet jewelled rice!",80.37909

Naively, we told her that since we had small appetites, we shouldn't need six plates. Little did we know... The food was so addicting, and the portions were fairly small, leading us to order round after round after round.We started off with a couple appetizers, outlined below.Turkish Manti Dumplings:I've heard so many different things about this dish - some people love it, others find it too bland. We loved it! The flavours were super complex; although being completely vegetarian, it didn't taste it at all. The eggplant had a rich smokey flavour that accentuated the dish. The creamy halloumi and tangy yogurt balanced the salty flavour of the eggplant. I didn't really taste the sweetness of the molasses, and really enjoyed the crisp dumpling surface contrasted with the creamy sauce. Fig Salad:The first and foremost flavour that jumps out at you when eating this salad is the floral taste, stemming from the orange blossom vinaigrette. The tangy vinegar had a very delicate blossom undertone; I could truly taste the fragrance and perfume of the orange blossom. The figs added a nice touch of sweetness; however, there were very little pieces. When we brought that up to the waitress, she was kind enough to accommodate and brought us a dish of a fresh fig cut up. The fig was delightfully fresh!

That said, the rice was addicting crispy and delicious! The lamb was braised to be fall apart tender, and the warm figs highlighted and lightened the meal. The nuts were a nice addition. Grilled Whole Banzino:This was by far my favourite dish of the entire meal! It was my first time having chermoullah, a pesto-like savoury salty sauce.

510,Italian place,"Came for a friend's birthday, and I thought it was unique, considering downtown, that such a quaint and homey restaurant was capable of sitting a party of 15+. However, this was the only positive of my experience here. I got the small mixed greens & root vegetables salad, which was lacklustre in taste. There was no dressing, and I tasted only 2 pieces of butternut squash. It was not filling at all, and consisted of mainly only salad leaves. My friends got the Insomnia burger and it was a tiny burger that did not even come with a side! Considering the price of the burger ($14), I think it should be customary to include a side. Other than the limited quantity and low quality of food, the service was horrible; our waitress was so rude! We thought it might be because of the fact that tip is automatically added onto the bill of a large party, as we saw her have a friendlier demeanour with other tables.Verdict: Will not be coming back here for food.

Thick pea meal bacon with an egg, soft bun, fresh tomatoes, and a powerful garlic aioli. SO GOOD. The potatoes and side salad were lovely too.Pulled pork eggs Benedict 4/5 The eggs were perfectly runny, in a great hollandaise sauce. Our only issue with this dish is that it's a little too sweet.

550,Italian place,"This review pains me a little to write, because I was so excited to try this place after hearing about the incredible reviews about the Vancouver location. The decor and ambience is elegant, and a fancy place that tends to house many business diners. Staff are friendly and helpful, and service is great. I've been here a few times and have tried a variety of items. I tried the Oshi sampler, which was quite good - they have salmon, ebi sushi and saba sushi. The taste is good, and it is well prepared. We also had the Prime Rib which was good, but was very small and not worth the $45 you pay for it. The Miku roll is also consistently good, but nothing groundbreaking for $20. I would say the best value is the Aburi Oishi sushi, as they are well torched and come with a good amount for the price.All in all, Miku is good - don't get me wrong. I think my issue is just the value, as the portions are so small and you can get the same quality and preparation of sushi elsewhere for a much more reasonable price. The food is good, but not amazing, and that tends to hit you when you get the bill at the end of your meal.",81.73136

570,Italian place,"Amazing. Some of the BEST sushi I've ever tasted! My friends and I were thoroughly impressed with the food. I love that each piece of sushi is super flavourful and it does not require soy sauce at all - you can tell each piece was carefully thought through and made. The chefs recommend you eat each piece without any soy sauce because they were made to be enjoyed without it. I was literally making sounds after I had each piece of sushi - it's that good. Yes, this place is quite pricey.. but it really is a great place to try, maybe for special occasions or events when you are craving some quality sushi and don't want to get all you can eat. The average price of a dish is probably $18.00 I would say, but a lot of the dishes were made for sharing with friends so definitely come with a party.

580,Italian place,"THE EXPERIENCEBeautiful, modern restaurant with lots of seating, specializing in blowtorched sushi (Aburi). The three of us were seated in a huge comfy booth that could probably fit six people. The server was very friendly! Be prepared to spend a lot if you're looking to get full.

I ordered the Coal Harbour and it had a very nice combination of seafood. The hotate crudo serving was generous. Loved the fresh spot prawns, which by the way, Ki doesn't have.  You could also order half orders which allows you to try more. Most importantly, their wasabi is much better than Ki. Ki offers powdered wasabi! I noticed this difference immediately.Had a wonderful and attentive server, unfortunately, don't have his name. He was not pushy and quite knowledgeable with the menu.

We arrived around 7pm on a Monday and there was only 1 other group in front of us waiting for  a table. The place is small so a wait is expected. I ordered the small Lanzhou Beef Noodle Soup. I found the soup to be quite plain even with the chili oil added but I was very thirsty after I finished my noodles. Perhaps they use a lot of msg. The noodles were not bad and the portion is a good size. The beef was good and not chewy like other places.,79.61292

610,Italian place,One of my favourite noodle houses in Toronto! If you're looking for a quick place to satisfy your noodlely cravings then GB hand-pulled noodles is the place to visit.I always order either the Special Lanzhou noodles or the Noodles with Homemade Pork Sauce. You really can't go wrong with either. The ingredients are always super fresh and flavourful. There's a decent noodle to toppings ratio and you probably won't have to deal with any bites that are only noodles. Service is prompt you will be expected to have your order ready while you are waiting in line and your food will arrive shortly after you sit down. Most smaller groups will have to share tables so don't expect to have an intimate date here... The price is also decent expect to pay around $15 per person after tax and tip. Overall would definitely recommend for my fellow noodle lovers!,82.921814

Service is prompt you will be expected to have your order ready while you are waiting in line and your food will arrive shortly after you sit down. Most smaller groups will have to share tables so don't expect to have an intimate date here... The price is also decent expect to pay around $15 per person after tax and tip. Overall would definitely recommend for my fellow noodle lovers!,89.483734

Most of the dishes were fusion styled and quite overpriced. $20 for a 8 piece roll and $50 for a 30 piece sashimi- Sake menu perhaps can include pictures / Kanji for those who recognize the label or Japanese name. - Bigger portions rather than making customers pay for multiple dishes to accompany their alcohol- Improve quality of sushi and sashimi - they weren't bad, but I was hoping for more luxury varieties like uni or toro for the price I paid.Summary:The ambience is great for a tapas style gathering with friends along with alcoholic beverages (what an izakaya should be) However, if you are looking for authentic Japanese cuisine and dining experience, this may not be the place for you. Our group of 4 ended up grabbing ramen down the street to fill us up.",87.474335

670,Italian place,"Came by with the girls today. Nomé is the best place to go in the area for food or drinks. Tuesday, Wednesday oyster nights are popping. Make sure to book reservations ahead of time to avoid disappointment. They've recently installed a naturalized water that kills bacteria with an ultraviolet light and boy does it taste good! Pay the extra couple dollars for it. Food is great, service is great. Can't complain. My favourites are the lobster fantasy roll, sashimi salad, sliders and the new addition on their featured menu ""smoked scallop roll"" is really tasty. The servers are hot. I love all of them even the owner Pat, which is super good looking as well Rachel is awesome and she's super attentive Come here now if you haven't alreadyNew location coming up soon!",83.336

720,Italian place,"Certainly La Carnita knows how to make delicious tacos. Each taco order comes with one taco so I decided to mix and match and tried a fish one, a chicken one, and a steak one.In Cod We Trust (favourite)The cod was soft, fluffy, and lightly battered on the outside. It also comes with ""Voltron sauce"" which is La Carnita's secret sauce named after a cartoon super robot lol. It uses ""tamari"" soy sauce as the base and I felt that it paired well with the cod. The extra cabbage, green apple, and cilantro on top complemented well with the fluffy cod by adding some crunch to it.Pollo Frito (almost tied with steak but I ranked this as my second favourite because it was slightly sweeter from the honey)  Crispy chicken thigh, peanut mole,honey, Rossy's hot sauce, green cabbage & salsa frescaThe chicken was nice and sweet and also tender and slightly crispy on the outside. If you like sweet stuff definitely try the pollo. Beware though that while the chicken is sweet some parts of the taco can also be spicier than expected from hot sauce.Carne Asada - Grilled Beef Steak, chipotle mayo, Tomatillo salsa, Lime Avocado, Crispy Shallots & cilantro. The steak was good but the salsa and mayo were a little too spicy (tasted like spicy mayo but stronger). For tacos I preferred the chicken and fish because of the lighter texture to go with the delicate tortillaFor starters we tried the ancho bbq wing but in comparison to the tacos they were more dry and somewhat small.

760,Italian place,"Very nice place for a get together with a group of friends. We were a party of 5, and the table reserved for us was at the back of the restaurant where the music was a little quieter and cozy.. and we had more privacy which I appreciated. We were here on a Thursday night at about 8:30, the restaurant was not that busy but it would still be a good idea to make reservation if you come with a bigger group.  We got the Thursday special, 100 for 100 malpeques, coconut mussels, chicken liver & oyster pate, calamari, fish & chips and a grilled sea bream. I was most impressed with the calamari, chicken liver & oyster pate, and fish & chips. Everything else was good but they did not wow me. They had a good selection of drinks, but they were pretty pricey. In terms of service, the waiters were knowledgeable and attentive, they made sure that our water was filled, checked in with us a few times during our meal, and refilled our toasts for the pate.  I would definitely come back to try other oysters!",79.94165

We ordered the oyster and chicken pate (this was good, though I think I prefer classic pate). We ordered the sardines (SOOOOO MANY BONES), the mussels (these were actually delicious, in a coconut curry sauce + fries were shoestring fries that were well fried), the calamari (this was interesting with a super crispy coat, but was very batter coating heavy, with little squid), and the fish and chips (same fries which were good, batter is very thin and overly oily, with a strong fishy taste....there is definitely better in the city!) Drinks are quite pricey, so not the best place to drink, but beers on tap have specials, and they have 7$ glasses of house wine.

800,Italian place,We went to Gusto101 for a friend's birthday and I can see why Sophie Trudeau and Michelle Obama chilled there too. The ambiance was really nice at night with low lighting. The server we had was friendly and helpful. The food was just superb! We all got pasta and I got the Mafalde ai Funghi which was recommended to me by friend and I'm so glad I did. This may be the best pasta dish I've eat had - and I've never been the hugest fan of mushrooms! The portion size also exceeded my expectations and I ended up even packing it (and I eat a lot so...lol). Would highly recommend to anyone! Afterwards I kept getting the same dish delivered and once added tried their burger on a whim. Is everything on their menu just amazing?!! The burger was cooked to perfection and tasted so succulent and delicious. Can't wait to go back/order the dishes again!,81.14933

820,Italian place,"I had a good time here!The restaurant is super cool and trendy, and the food is really good!I came here on a Friday night with a group of 5 people and we had a reservation for 6:30. It wasn't super busy but by the time we left it had really filled out and had a lineup out the door. The restaurant is dimly lit and has a really cool industrial look to it. We were sat upstairs and am told that the roof opens up in the warmer months to make a giant outdoor patio, I'd love to come back in the summer to check that out. Our server was pretty attentive, they were nice about giving us extra time to select drinks and food and we didn't feel rushed at all. A few times the food came to the table and was given to the wrong person but it wasn't a big deal. For the food, I ordered the kale salad, I liked it, I found it a bit salty with all the cheese, but I liked the pine nuts and currants for texture, it was also a very large salad, I think it could be easily shared as a side for two people. I ordered the cacio e pepe pasta which was really good. The noodles were cooked perfectly and I really liked the taste of the sauce and the pepper. It looked like a small portion but it ended up being quite rich and salty and I actually had a hard time finishing it. I'm not a fan of mushrooms but a few people had the mushroom mafalde pasta and enjoyed it, they also loved the mushroom bruschetta. Lastly, I tried a piece of the steak and it was good, cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned, it wasn't outstanding but definitely solid. I liked the sourdough bread too, although I think it was a bit pricey for bread, which is often free at other restaurants. I didn't order wine but it's $1 per ounce which is a great deal. Overall this is a really cool place and the menu is pretty extensive so I think everyone could find something suitable. Prices are not outrageous, I think they're appropriate for the food quality and portion. I would definitely come back to maybe try one of their specials, unfortunately lasagna was on special for a different day, and also to experience the open roof in the summer!",85.413475

We were sat upstairs and am told that the roof opens up in the warmer months to make a giant outdoor patio, I'd love to come back in the summer to check that out. Our server was pretty attentive, they were nice about giving us extra time to select drinks and food and we didn't feel rushed at all. A few times the food came to the table and was given to the wrong person but it wasn't a big deal. For the food, I ordered the kale salad, I liked it, I found it a bit salty with all the cheese, but I liked the pine nuts and currants for texture, it was also a very large salad, I think it could be easily shared as a side for two people. I ordered the cacio e pepe pasta which was really good. The noodles were cooked perfectly and I really liked the taste of the sauce and the pepper. It looked like a small portion but it ended up being quite rich and salty and I actually had a hard time finishing it. I'm not a fan of mushrooms but a few people had the mushroom mafalde pasta and enjoyed it, they also loved the mushroom bruschetta. Lastly, I tried a piece of the steak and it was good, cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned, it wasn't outstanding but definitely solid. I liked the sourdough bread too, although I think it was a bit pricey for bread, which is often free at other restaurants. I didn't order wine but it's $1 per ounce which is a great deal. Overall this is a really cool place and the menu is pretty extensive so I think everyone could find something suitable. Prices are not outrageous, I think they're appropriate for the food quality and portion. I would definitely come back to maybe try one of their specials, unfortunately lasagna was on special for a different day, and also to experience the open roof in the summer!",94.04741

840,Italian place,"I loved the setting and layout of the restaurant! It's located in the heart of downtown.It was a sunny afternoon and we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. If you'd like to sit outside on the patio, I recommend making reservations and bringing sunglasses! Our waitress was kind and helpful when it came to asking for a dessert and candle for my boyfriend (not complimentary - you do have to pay for it). It was a success and he was definitely surprised! However, the service was quite slow for brunch and perhaps that was due to the busy hour. I wasn't too bothered by it, as were some people.I ordered a Berry bowl because I was feeling 'fruity', however I wasn't too happy with the overall taste of it. It was more on the sour side and I prefer sweet - plus the yogurt was actual warm rather than cold. I've never had warm yogurt served as part of a berry bowl. Don't get me wrong, I still ate it but it wasn't the best. Probably WOULDN'T recommend that order. Although, my boyfriend ordered the Gusto burger and he found it to be flavourful and well cooked, so based on how happy he was with his meal I'd recommend it too! Lastly, I had to top off our brunch date with a Sangria and I have no complaints about it. Tasted just perfect. Overall I'd say Gusto 101 is a nice spot to catch up with friends or have a one on one date. Bound to have a good time here!",85.07836

850,Italian place,"Once you go Konjiki, you can't go back. Seriously, the best ramen you can have in Toronto. Michelin recommended and this is one spot you don't want to miss out on ;)It gets better each time I visit but I always go for the Tofu nuggets! They are crispy on the outside, hot and soft on the inside. Definitely a must order!The following are my favourite ramen bowls at Konjiki, starting with my TOP FAVOURITE:1. Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen - Best. Ramen. Ever. If you love smokiness in everything (in food, cocktails, weed LMAO just kidding), you will love this one. Highly recommend. #一試難忘2. Vegetarian Ramen with Creamy Potato Soy Milk Broth - Hella yass. This one is so creamy good; I wanted to drink all the broth lol. Though it is vegetarian, I added braised pork belly (+$3) for my meat-lover self lol.3. Signature Clam Broth Ramen (Shio) - Definitely a classic at Konjiki. If you have never had calm broth before, this will blow yo' mind! It is actually very light compared to the usual chicken- or pork-based.I have yet to try the ramen with lobster broth! It seems like they only have it on Wednesdays! Gotta make time for thissss... till next time :)P.S.

Michelin recommended and this is one spot you don't want to miss out on ;)It gets better each time I visit but I always go for the Tofu nuggets! They are crispy on the outside, hot and soft on the inside. Definitely a must order!The following are my favourite ramen bowls at Konjiki, starting with my TOP FAVOURITE:1. Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen - Best. Ramen. Ever. If you love smokiness in everything (in food, cocktails, weed LMAO just kidding), you will love this one. Highly recommend. #一試難忘2. Vegetarian Ramen with Creamy Potato Soy Milk Broth - Hella yass. This one is so creamy good; I wanted to drink all the broth lol. Though it is vegetarian, I added braised pork belly (+$3) for my meat-lover self lol.3. Signature Clam Broth Ramen (Shio) - Definitely a classic at Konjiki. If you have never had calm broth before, this will blow yo' mind! It is actually very light compared to the usual chicken- or pork-based.I have yet to try the ramen with lobster broth! It seems like they only have it on Wednesdays! Gotta make time for thissss... till next time :)P.S. I'm not sure if you would still have room for dessert but Saryo Cafe & Dessert shares the same unit as Konjiki in the front of the restaurant.

860,Italian place,"Pros: Very good bowl of ramenOne of the best karaage in a ramen restaurantCons:No extra noodle optionNot too much seatingTook me long enough, but I finally got a chance to try this place.  This is a Michelin recommended ramen and it doesn't disappoint.  It will be one of the better ramens you have here in Toronto.Konjiki is on the smaller side for a ramen restaurant.  They have a large table in the middle best suited for singles coming in.  There are about 5 tables for 2's and 2 tables for 4.  Needless to say, this isn't a place for large groups.  They could sit a large group in the middle table but it's not the most ideal as you won't be able to see/talk to certain people in the group and/or you could be seated with strangers as well.OK, on to the most important part, the ramen!!  Konjiki's ramen is some of the best you will have in the city.  Their menu is simple but what they do, they do well.  You have 2 signature clam broth ramen, 3 tonkotsu ramen, and a veggie ramen.  There's a lobster ramen on Wednesday that replaces the 3 tonkotsu ramen.  We ordered a clam ramen and a tonkotsu ramen with a side karaage.As I said, the ramen here is one of the best you can get in Toronto.  The broth here is super rich and very tasty. I had the smoky black tonkotsu and it was amazing.  You can really taste the quality and time put in to the broth which is the most important part of ramen for me.  The noodles were very good as well.  Ramen noodles should be served aldente so there's some bite to it.  Konjiki does an excellent job of this.  The karaage is probably the best I've ever had at a ramen restaurant.  When a restaurant puts that much effort into it's side dishes, you know that's a great thing!I have but one beef with his place but unfortunately it's a big one for me.  I'm a big eater and I can eat a ton of noodles in one sitting.  I always get extra noodles when I have ramen.  This place doesn't have that option.  If I want extra noodles I have to get another bowl which is another $15, not happening.  It's the only ramen place I've been to that doesn't offer this option.  This place would easily be a 5 star if not for this.No extra noodle option withstanding, this place is a must try for all ramen lovers.  For bigger eaters like me, you might want to have a snack before or after.",81.29166

870,Italian place,There used to be a line up here when they first opened. Now there's no line ups at all! Because it received a Michelin star In another country I wanted to try this place out. Their broths are definitely different than your regular broth. I've been here maybe about 3-4 times now and I keep going to see maybe if the flavours have changed and it has! When they had line ups the broths were not d flavourful maybe because they had to rush and make orders since there were more people.I'm not so fond of their noodles either because it doesn't seem as authentic. They are straight noodles but the one I had was a bit hard for my liking. The pricing here is average. It could go a little cheaper based on what I'm getting.

880,Italian place,"It's taken me a week to process my experience and finally come up with a rating. Despite some negatives, I'm giving Konjiki 4-stars. We came here on a Sunday night, looking for a warm & quick meal. Konjiki fit both categories. To my surprise, we were seated immediately at the communal table which fits about 20 people. There are only several tables on the perimeter of the restaurant that provide some privacy. Nevertheless, right after we were seated (around 6:00 pm) a lineup started forming in the entryway. We ordered the Asahi Dry Black Beer ($8.00), Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen (13.00), and the Intense Shoyu Clam Broth Ramen ($14.00). The drinks came immediately, whereas the ramen took another 10 minutes to arrive. The service is quick, pleasant and efficient--no complaints there. The food, however, has some inconsistencies. The Smoky Black Tonkotsu Ramen was overpowering in flavour. When I eat ramen, I make sure to finish my broth. This, however, wasn't one of those instances. The intensity of the flavour came from the fat content in the broth & the amount of salt.The smokiness only came through in the cherry tomatoes (surprisingly). The Clam Broth Ramen was good, but I had the opposite issue with the broth--it was underwhelming. There simply wasn't enough seafood flavour. The portions are also fairly small for the price. Conclusion? I'm in love with the creativity that goes into the ramen, as well as the selection of unique flavours. Would I return?

890,Italian place,"I came here with 2 other friends to try Konjiki's lobster ramen on a Wednesday. We all ordered the same thing, lobster ramen + tamago (egg).The ramen had a generous portion of well cooked (e.g. not chewy) lobster meat. The lobster had a hint of sweetness to it. I also like how they added a small amount of lobster roe? the orange-yellow paste on top of the lobster. Some people might find it a bit fishy, but to me it was the essence! The broth, on the other hand, fell short of my expectations. The broth had a promising orange-red colour, which suggested they simmered the lobster shells. However, all 3 of us agreed that we could not taste any component of seafood in the broth. I was glad I added the egg. It was not salty like many ramen restaurants. And despite eating the egg approximately half way through my ramen, the yolk was still 50% runny!The appearance of the sous vide cha siu reminded me of sliced ham from the deli counter. So my expectations for it was set quite low. However, after taking a few bites, I actually quite enjoyed it. Despite it's ""smooth"" looking appearance, there was still the texture of meat. The ramen noodles were alright, not too memorable. I don't see myself getting the lobster ramen again, it's more of a ""tried it once and it's sufficient"" type of dish. But I will come back to try their clam broth ramen!",75.475685

We didn't try anything sweet, nothing really caught my eye on the sweet side. We order 2 Eggs Benny - One was the Bacon, Cheddar and Mango Salsa Benny, the other was the Pulled Pork Benny. Eggs Benny dishes come with salad and home fries (big fan of the salad dressing). WOW.... Both were absolutely delicious. The combination of the Mango Salsa and Bacon was amazing.

The restaurant is quite small, but the turnover was quite good. I really appreciated that they put a bench outside for those waiting. Once in, I knew exactly what I wanted to order, given that I've studied their menu and yelp reviews beforehand. We decided to get the Cairo classic, the chicken sandwich, falafel app, eggplant appetizer and their honey cardamom latte. We were 3 and found that to be plenty of food.Let me say that these are THE BEST falafels I've ever had and I've had plenty. The sauce that's given, which is a spicy tahini mix was to die for. The eggplant appetizer was delicious as well. Eating it with their homemade pita bread...oh my I'm salivating. The Cairo classic and chicken sandwich were also very good. I thought the chicken was a bit too saucy and it was hard to taste the chicken. The foul was very good, but I wish there was mooooore!! Finally, the latte was superb. I could have had it all day. Side note, they serve cold water in these cute clay pots that keep the water nice and cold. The service was great and the food was authentic.

Service was okay, received our food on time but the waitress was a bit rude, and she disappeared for awhile. Moving on to the food, I tried the Shrimp Poboy and the Mind Blowing Chicken Sandwich. I did not enjoy the Shrimp, it was crispy and well cooked but there wasn't any flavor to it. The sauce on top was Tahini and it was very average. Moving on to the staple, the Chicken sandwich was okay. The bread was nicely buttered but in terms of an actual dish, I wasn't too impressed. There was flavor from the base which I believe is a foul (middle eastern breakfast dish) and all topped with more tahini. I wasn't too impressed and won't be coming back.

All the dishes were different and fresh. Would definitely drop by again! Portions were more than filling for one person. Price was average about $15 per meal.

I enjoyed the taco but just wish the duck was warmed up before being placed on the dish.For the main course I got, what I mentioned above, the chicken and waffles. At first sight, I was felt pretty good about the way the dish was plated. It looked pretty just like the photos. The fried chicken was the main selling part of this dish, it was seasoned, juicy and crispy. The chicken is seasoned with a bit of ginger which I think elevated the taste of the heavy dish. But the waffles was a huge disappointment to me. It was soggy and had this weird texture to it. It tasted like something too healthy to be together with the awesome tasting fried chicken. The syrup for the waffles tastes good too.If they can fix the waffles then this will be a five star dish.",77.04279

The clams still have sand in them. The sauce is actually quite good but also quite heavy for the udon pairing. Then you have random pieces of meat here and there, overcooked steak bits and mushy Italian sausage bits. I highly don't recommend to anyone with taste buds, which is a majority of the human population.WORST OF ALL, IT'S SO FREAKING DARK IN HERE THAT I CAN'T SEE WHAT I'M EATING!! smh :(My friend had a bland coffee-less tasting latte to start. She ordered the chicken and waffles. We have no idea why there's a freaking lamb bone just sitting on the side of her plate... like wth. The chicken is ok, odd that it sits the sweeter side for fried chicken. The waffles are mushy and terrible. Maple syrup is drizzled over the entire thing and successfully overpowers everything. Gross.I paid $70 for this and didn't even digest it cuz everything hurt too much and I didn't want to die. :( It wasn't just me, my friend had tummy aches too.

1040,Italian place,"I'm always trying to find brunch spots around Markham, but I have to say that Inspire is still one of the best in the city.Small little restaurant in Main St Markham but always full of people. The best is definitely their chicken and waffles as you get the fluffiness from the waffles with a hint of sweet while getting a textural difference of crispness from the fried chicken. The sweet and savory is balanced really well, so if that's your cup of tea you definitely need to try it.I also had their waffles with pulled pork. Great dish but I think I prefer the chicken as the pulled pork was very saucy (yet delicious) but a bit heavy for me so I would want to take a break from it.Would definitely come back to try the other things on the menu.

1070,Italian place,"I've been to this location once and basing the review on this experience as I used to go to the old location before the move. Food is good but a little pricey for the portions but it is expected given the location lol. They satisfied my pad see ew craving that I've having since Miami (best pad see ew I had was in Miami... Little Havana) thai iced tea was strong and Tom yum was authentic!

1090,Italian place,"My friend and I had both wanted to try this place for a long time, so we came here last night. We arrived at around 5:45/6 and were seated immediately - no wait. However, when we left at around 7, the lineup was almost out the door. So come early if you can!The restaurant is located on a quiet, not so busy street which is nice, and the atmosphere inside is pretty laid back. We sat downstairs but they have some upstairs seating as well.The service was fast and friendly, our orders were taken within minutes and the water refills were instant - which is a big deal for me!The food itself was great. I had the pad gra prow and my friend had the green curry. The pad gra prow is becoming my go to dish at Thai restaurants and this one was amazing. There is a large portion of meat (I got the ground pork), and the flavour is really good. We both also liked the green curry a lot because it seemed a bit lighter than most other places' green curries, but still had the same great taste.This will definitely become one of my go to restaurants downtown!",81.38177

The Patria was very traditional seafood dish while the other one was quite unique and had more intense flavours.

It is a great little hole-in-the-wall restaurant... which is literally a tiny hole in the wall.  If possible, ask to be seated outside!The Guacamole/Salsa were great - and was a good size to share among 4 people.  Would definitely recommend. We ordered a number of plates to share... but to be honest, I was not blown away by their tacos.  Definitely much bigger than El Carnita - that's for sure, and MUCH better value - but the taste was pretty average. We ordered... Tacos de: Pollo al Carbon, Pescado, Carnitas.The Mexican Street Corn is always my favourite part of these types of restaurants! Must have. The waiter was fantastic, and gave us a really cool run-down and lesson on types of Tequilas and Margaritas.  We were very appreciative!

Two people literally cannot stand side by side. It was VERY hot, and very small. It is a great little hole-in-the-wall restaurant... which is literally a tiny hole in the wall.  If possible, ask to be seated outside!The Guacamole/Salsa were great - and was a good size to share among 4 people.  Would definitely recommend. We ordered a number of plates to share... but to be honest, I was not blown away by their tacos.  Definitely much bigger than El Carnita - that's for sure, and MUCH better value - but the taste was pretty average. We ordered... Tacos de: Pollo al Carbon, Pescado, Carnitas.The Mexican Street Corn is always my favourite part of these types of restaurants! Must have.

1170,Italian place,"Sadly, looks like this whole chain is going downhill. Was at the Dupont location about a month ago and the menu was different with fewer options, no specials and then my favourite drink that I always order, which is supposed to come with berries in the glass came as a pink sugary tasting mess that tasted like they put next to no alcohol in a glass full of pink lemonade mix. The food was bland and uninspiring compared to what it used to be. Service was barely there with no one coming around to take orders or check on us. Now their other location in the Junction has been shut down with a red card from Toronto health inspectors for pest infestations. I give this whole chain of restaurants another year before they start shutting down completely. So sad. Used to be my favourite for good tacos.",79.52213

The food was delicious, fresh and love the selection of hot sauces they had for me. We started off with the guac and chips. Guac was great. And we also ordered the bucket of shrimp. That was Delicious!!!!! The shrimps had so much flavor!!! I had the lobster tacos for entree. That was delicious as well. It was bursting with flavor, with a hint of spice, the cheese, tomatoes and guac on the side. Oh man! My friend had the carne asada. The steak was cooked perfectly. Tender and juicy and of course with the sauce on top it was bursting with flavor and a bit spicy. My other friend had the burrito and my husband had the short rib tacos. Alll were super delicious. The service we received were great. Our waitress was very personable and friendly and her recommendations were great.

1190,Italian place,I'm always looking to try New Mexican places In toronto so we went to playa cabana . The place is fair small and has an authentic Mexican ambiance . I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time especially for dinner as there is limited seating . The service was a little slow overall. We ordered three appetizers Chips and salsa - 4/5 - the salsa felt like it was lacking flavourCorn - you get 4 pieces of corn - 3/5 - the corn was sweet instead of being spicy or more flavourful. Chorizo conquistador - 3/5 - basically bbq chorizo slices .For the mains we chose to get 3 hard and 3 soft tacos . Unlike other Mexican restaurants you cannot pick individual tacos . You have to get 3 of the same kind - hard or soft Hard chorizo taco - 5/5 - hands down the best thing we ate there. It was full of flavour and spice. It came with guacamole and salsa . The ground chorizo was way tastier than the appetizer chorizo slices . Soft taco - chicken with mango 2/5 - no flavour at all in the chicken . It was cold and lacked flavour all together . Either the chicken was made hours ago or the chef didn't put any time into preparing it . We are 1.5 of the 3 tacos and let the rest go back For dessert - you have 3 choices We opted for cheesecake with caramel . The cake was average and it was the equivalent of a grocery store cake . Overall - the ambience and select items showed potential but not sure if we are going to go back here as there are several other Mexican places that might be better . Will keep searching other hidden gems !!!,81.09494

1196,ice cream shop,I'm always looking to try New Mexican places In toronto so we went to playa cabana . The place is fair small and has an authentic Mexican ambiance . I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time especially for dinner as there is limited seating . The service was a little slow overall. We ordered three appetizers Chips and salsa - 4/5 - the salsa felt like it was lacking flavourCorn - you get 4 pieces of corn - 3/5 - the corn was sweet instead of being spicy or more flavourful. Chorizo conquistador - 3/5 - basically bbq chorizo slices .For the mains we chose to get 3 hard and 3 soft tacos . Unlike other Mexican restaurants you cannot pick individual tacos . You have to get 3 of the same kind - hard or soft Hard chorizo taco - 5/5 - hands down the best thing we ate there. It was full of flavour and spice. It came with guacamole and salsa . The ground chorizo was way tastier than the appetizer chorizo slices . Soft taco - chicken with mango 2/5 - no flavour at all in the chicken . It was cold and lacked flavour all together . Either the chicken was made hours ago or the chef didn't put any time into preparing it .

1200,Italian place,"First time coming here because I usually avoid places with lineups like the plague anddddd mannnn every time I drive past this place I see a lineup. Finally came on a Friday afternoon around 1:45PM and it was still busy, but luckily they had 2 bar stool seatings left just for us. Parking was a bit of a struggle, when we went the front parking was all full as was the parking on the side (also, alot of the parking is reserved for their neighbouring units). Not sure if they changed the ordering system or what, but we were a bit confused during our visit. Instead of ordering at the front like the others mentioned, the server was walking around taking orders and left the front unmanned. Whateva no matter really, just seemed a bit pointless to have him walking around taking orders. We just shared an Eggs Benedict w Smoked Salmon, Portabello shrooms, & Kale. This came with fried mini potatoes and a small, light salad. The potatoes and salad were fresh. But the eggs benny thooooooo... :( . My first qualm was with the English muffin it was on, it ain't toasted which makes it quite difficult to slice with the provided butter knife. Second complaint, that raw kale. I don't get it...why RAW? Imo, lightly sauteed kale with some seasoning would've made this dish much better. Kale doesn't really give you that crunch factor if that was the reasoning for adding it (nor does it really add any flavour). Also , the amount of portabello mushrooms were weak today. Also ordered a flat white, which was good. And a matcha affogato which is essentially matcha + vanilla ice cream, it was good as well. The service here is good - the servers were very nice. But the food came out at a snail's pace which I don't understand why since literally the only thing that needs to be cooked to order is poached eggs. Potatoes we got were just warm so it wasn't the taters slowing things down. Anyways, by the time the food came out, my coffee had already cooled down so that kinda sucked too. (Also I couldn't get that perfect brunch pic of latte art + food since the coffee came wayyyy before the food)Overall a lil disappointed tbh, overhyped. Thought the long lineups would have been justified but alas....I'll be back to try their pancakes though! Those looked pretty good.FYI... Cash or Debit only!",80.90379

I usually go for their simple breakfast (scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes and toast) - they make their scrambled eggs well, not dry and overcooked like most places.

But otherwise if you're a food snob (and I mean this with love) and/or long-time Toronto resident, stay faaaaar away from this place. The menu is extensive, but super basic and overpriced. There are so many better brunch places in a food city like Toronto, so save that $15-30 for elsewhere. Even Cora's has better food and value than here imo. Vegans beware, not many options here for you besides fruit. I ordered the Greek yogurt (0%) parfait with fresh fruit, granola, and honey on the side - decent sized portion and the ingredients were fresh, but for $11, maybe not so appealing.

1310,Italian place,"3.5 stars Whoever is in charge of the menu or marketing is a bit of a genius... Barque Rack O'Bama.  Really??  This is honestly one of the best named dishes in Toronto and probably one of the key reasons why I tried this place before the other best Toronto BBQ places.Aside from the great name, Barque on Roncy is a nice family friendly bar.  Though the tables for 2 are really small and barely held the dishes on it, the space is bigger than most places on Roncy and you're not overly crowded.  There's a bit of bar seating for those who dont have a reservations and you do need a rez here.  It gets busy quickly on a Saturday with a constant flow of families.  Service here is friendly and fairly quick.  We were greeted and shown to our tables with no issues.  We had our food also delivered with an issue as well.Chopped Kale Salad - Ok I know I know... who gets a salad at a BBQ place.  Well I do cause I dont eat THAT much meat and I wasn't feeling mac & cheese or poutine side.  Which by the way looked monstrous.  We got a large and I will say its a very healthy size... easily feeds 2+.  It was nicely dressed and the pickled cabbage and carrots was a nice crunchy addition.  The fat white blobs of turnip... less so.  Mostly flavourless.  3.5/5Rib Taster - Star of the meal... you get 3 to 4 ribs per sauce flavour.  So the Barque Rack O'Bama, Sweet Heat, and Dry Rub.  I can safely say that the sauces and flavour is good.  There are definite clear smoke rings on these which is much better than most other places.  Were these tender?  Only one... the sweet heat.  Were they meaty?

1390,Italian place,"Honestly I can't even think of words to begin this review. This restaurant is simply AMAZING. From the moment I entered, we were treated with incredible service. We arrived 30 minutes early for our reservation, and the manager personally took our drink order to enjoy while we waited for our table. The dim lights and ambience of the place made it easy to relax and enjoy dinner. Its a large plate sharing type of restaurant where a different server brings out each dish and describes it to you. We ordered multiple dishes and they even switched our plates and utensils between each order so as not to mix the flavors! The hostess was pleasant, and service was nothing short of what I would expect at this type of place. 5 stars from me! We ordered a total of 4 dishes to split between 2 people, which was a good amount because we were so hungry! If you're not really hungry, then 2-3 dishes shared between 2 people would be ideal. We of course ordered the 19 ingredient signature Singapore slaw, they bring it out in a huge tray and toss it in front of you - the server even let me take a picture of the salad before he tossed it haha! The salad itself was incredibly satisfying, the dressing was perfectly seasoned and the salad itself was light and refreshing which is surprising for 19 ingredients! We also ordered the goat cheese tarte which was delicious! The third dish was shrimp and lobster ravioli, 8 could honestly eat this ALL DAY LONG! The shrimp itself with the garlic sauce was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. As a shrimp enthusiast, I make sure to always order the shrimp dishes, and this did not disappoint. It was definitely one of the best shrimp dishes I've ever had. Lastly, we ordered the Top Chef Curry Chicken dish which is the winner of top chef. I honestly don't think I've ever had such perfectly cooked chicken, with a crispy thin skin. The chef recommends that you eat each bite of chicken with a piece of grilled pineapple and try the different sauces - mint with a spicy sauce and a coconut curry sauce. Honestly words cannot describe how delectable this dish was, I could eat this every single day of my life and not be bored!Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant and it's experience to EVERYONE, at least once. The one thing I have to add is that it is quite expensive, around $20-$40 per each entrée, so if you're on a budget I recommend trying 1-2 dishes and to make reservations for a special occasion! If not the dishes we ordered, there is definitely something on the menu for everyone!! This place gets 5 Stars from me. I will definitely be back to try everything else on the menu!",77.48045

1480,Italian place,"I saw this restaurant featured in an episode of Kim's Convenience (season 1) and ever since then, I've wanted to try it. I ordered the most popular dish combination soon tofu and dolsotbab with beef, shrimp, and mussel. The stew came with a few slices of pork, one mussel, one unpeeled shrimp, and an ABUNDANCE of tofu. It also came with a hot stone pot of purple rice which was scooped into our bowls by the server. The server then poured water into the hot stone pot and left it soaking on our tables. I was unsure if there was a purpose or they wanted to grab all the dirty dishes together. Puzzled, we ate with soaking wet rice on our side.The stew was okay, the soup wasn't too rich in flavour. Maybe it was because I didn't ask for it too spicy. It also came with an egg on the side you crack yourself into the stew which is pretty cool. I love rich stew and the soon tofu wasn't the greatest for me. I hope their other dishes have promise and I believe they do based on the number of customers. The prices at Buk Chang Doon are definitely competitive compared to their Korean restaurant counterparts in Koreatown. Good service and convenient location!",75.27614

1580,Italian place,"Always walked passed this restaurant in Chinatown but never actually went in to try but after seeing the reviews, we had to try it and it did not disappoint. We got the House Special Noodles and the Steamed Pork and Chives dumplings. The noodles had a very tasty sweet sauce and is definitely great to share as the flavour might get tiring after a few bites. The dumplings were also pretty good! $9.99 for 15 dumplings and they were pretty big and also great to share because they are very filling. Each table also has their condiments in which you can make your sauce to dip your dumplings in with how you like it. The dumplings are also freshly made in the front of the store which gave this place a very authentic feel and the service was very fast! No complaints. Definitely want to come back and try their pan fried dumplings.",81.56787

They don't taste exactly like home but you won't hear me saying these don't taste GREAT.I wouldn't really waste my time on the fried dumplings, though I can see why they might appeal to other people. I've tried the lamb and the presentation was fun.But the boiled dumplings are where it's at: plump, nice wrapping, generously filled. The pork and shrimp is always a go-to: lots of pork, big full shrimp in each dumpling. I also like the pork and chive, and pork and fennel. Both generously filled also.The regular dishes are also worth your time and money! Mapo tofu: delicious, the garlicky sauce is amazing with the rice. Shanghai fried noodles: alright, super saucy if that's your preference. Egg and tomatoes: really, really good. They taste great. Kung pao chicken: tender, real pieces of chicken, generous, delicious.

You'll question how a pizza can cook in a couple of minutes if you load it with toppings. You'll wonder if it'll even be filling since the crust is so thin. Then you'll take a bite out of it and all those thoughts will go away. This goes without saying: build your own pizza.

1680,Italian place,"Love Love Love this place! I was a Ryerson student and I've been walking past this restaurant for over a year but I've never bothered to try it out thinking that it's just a typical pizza place and there are other less fancy pizza places for cheaper price. What got me interested is their Build your own pizza concept with unlimited toppings FREE ($12.85). I don't know any restaurant with this kind of offer and it is a very fair price in this market. When we went on Sunday evening at 6.45pm, there was a line-up to the door and it took us 10-15mins to get to the order-taking/build your pizza station. I chose half classic Tomato sauce and half garlic Pesto sauce with extra mozzarella cheese. The guy putting on the cheese only added a little more when I said extra though and it was a little awkward to ask him more. I then had Smoked Ham, ground beef, red onions, roasted garlic, spinach, green pepper, mushroom and pineapple. They then cook it in an open-fire-blazing oven. Waiting for the pizza to cook took 5-10mins. It didn't seem too long as the person prepping the cooked pizzas were doing his job so fast and it was entertaining/fascinating to watch. I then added barbecue sauce drizzle. Another reason why I love this place is their additional cheese, Tabasco sauce, Sriracha, herb, and chilli flakes available on the side. I am a cheese lover, and I like a little spiciness in my food. I will definitely come back. Food: 5/5Price: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5",81.408646

1720,Italian place,"Walked over an hour to get because a guy in my hostel told me this was the best Indian / Pakistani food in Toronto. I ordered  two of the lamb chicken and beef kabobs , a side of garlic naan and a samosa .The food was spiced and cooked to perfection .  My only qualms with this place are that the Kebabs are on the smaller side and you  can't adjust the heat level since the meat is premarinated. You can add a side of chiilis but it's not the same .  . Whenever you go to an Indian spot and get tandoori items you usually get a green sauce as well as a sweet purple / red sauce .which I got with my kebabs here .With the exception of the raita this place offered the best duping sauces I've ever.I highly recommend you check this place out if you're planning to visit Toronto and have a hankering for Indian .I'll definitely be back .",84.305084

1730,Italian place,Best naan anywhere. Do not go without ordering their naan!!We absolutely love their butter chicken. Our classic order is two butter naan with the butter chicken and this is the right amount for two people without overdoing it. I've only taken one star off because we would love to order the rice but it's so blinking expensive (even though they do give you a lot - better value for 4 people and still enough rice).

1760,Italian place,"Fishman lobster clubhouse is a must visit when in Toronto for seafood lovers. The restaurant walls are encased with tanks of lobsters, king crabs, Dungeness crabs...you name it. Our party of 8 ordered the pre fix family style meal (item #G) which says for 6-7 ppl, but it was definitely more than enough food to feed all of us. We ended up with a party tray of leftovers. They start you off with soup followed by deep fried large oysters in sauce, king crab/ lobster towers, fish, pea shoots, and lobster roe fried rice. There's also dessert!The stellar items from our meal was of course the king crab (6lb) and lobster (7lb) towers. Both were prepared in similar ways. The king crab (HK style) was deliciously coated in a blend of seasonings that included a light mix of sweetness, tanginess, and savoriness with a bit of a kick but not spicy. The fries that surround the king crab tower are what you've never had elsewhere. It beats your local McDonald's or Burger King any day. Covered in the same seasoning, the fries are so addicting and will have you reaching for more without realizing it. The lobster with dried garlic is so plump and juicy. Coated in the same light batter, it was similar in taste to that of the king crab but without the sweet and tangy flavor. If you think the lobster meat is a bit bland, just coat it with the dried garlic to add extra crunch and taste! By the end of our meal, we were waddling out of the restaurant. The price is unbeatable for the quality. The amount paid per person was just as much as what we might have paid for just an entree with drinks at a restaurant in NYC. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in town!",76.74608

Coated in the same light batter, it was similar in taste to that of the king crab but without the sweet and tangy flavor. If you think the lobster meat is a bit bland, just coat it with the dried garlic to add extra crunch and taste! By the end of our meal, we were waddling out of the restaurant. The price is unbeatable for the quality. The amount paid per person was just as much as what we might have paid for just an entree with drinks at a restaurant in NYC.

1764,Japanese restaurant,"Fishman lobster clubhouse is a must visit when in Toronto for seafood lovers. The restaurant walls are encased with tanks of lobsters, king crabs, Dungeness crabs...you name it. Our party of 8 ordered the pre fix family style meal (item #G) which says for 6-7 ppl, but it was definitely more than enough food to feed all of us. We ended up with a party tray of leftovers. They start you off with soup followed by deep fried large oysters in sauce, king crab/ lobster towers, fish, pea shoots, and lobster roe fried rice. There's also dessert!The stellar items from our meal was of course the king crab (6lb) and lobster (7lb) towers. Both were prepared in similar ways. The king crab (HK style) was deliciously coated in a blend of seasonings that included a light mix of sweetness, tanginess, and savoriness with a bit of a kick but not spicy.

Was able to call the day of for reservations for 3 and they had a 7pm opening. I recommend you make reservations because this place get packed! Parking was fine when we got there but was crazy when we were leaving. I can tell that besides families, a lot of big groups (10+ people) come here too. For the 3 of us, we got course E. And we loved every little bit of it. Side note: the pricing they have on the menu is more or less what you will pay. Depending on the size/weight of lobster/crab they have, the pricing can change a bit. But your server will come over to your table (with the live lobster and crab) and show you the price difference you'll be paying. And at that point you can decide if it's okay or not. Every dish was so sooo so good. The meat on the crab and lobster was juicy and flavorful. Can't complain. And the portion size is HUGE so most tables definitely had to go trays (yes, trays) and boxes. **No credit cards accepted! So for all you visitors (like us) make sure you have CA$H on you!!! They will take American dollars**Overall the service was fine. Everyone who we spoke to were friendly. They did forget about us for a moment and forgot to bring out the fried rice to us. We had to ask twice for it. Sure it's not cheap for a family dinner but trust me, it's worth it. And think of it as you can get 2 delicious meals out of it because of the big portion size.",79.71216

1790,Italian place,"Fishman Lobster Clubhouse is our go-to place whenever we want to impress guests from overseas. This is because in Asia, imported lobster can cost an arm and a leg. A heaping mountain of fresh lobster meat is still impressive every time when we see it arrive on the table!The menu has multiple combo options that of course revolve around lobster or king crab. Meal price is based on weight of the seafood, and the live lobster is brought to you for inspection before it is prepared. Within a short time, the huge lobster mountain will arrive, assuming that's the style that you ordered. The large pieces are fried with a delicious and light batter but the meat remains tender inside. Definitely suggest picking the lobster pieces using the gloves that they provide since they're quite greasy. The accompanying dishes such as snow pea leaves with goji berries (superfood apparently), lobster roe fried rice and steamed fish are all consistent and come in huge portions as well. By the way they can also drizzle the lobster batter with salted egg yolk if you ask for an additional $40 or so, it does further enhance the flavours a bit but we didn't think it was worth it as you're here for the abundant seafood meat. The lobster can get to be too much of a (greasy) good thing by the end, but staff are quite willing to pack your food if required.Lunch time is the better deal for combos but dinner time may be more suitable for large table reservations for a lobster feast. The restaurant recently relocated south to a larger venue to handle more happy customers. Also be prepared to bring a wad of cash bills as the preferred form of payment.",76.72713

I highly recommend getting their chicken wing, lamb skewer, press sushi, torch sushi, and their desserts. Maybe avoid their soups, they were very salty.The service was good too. It was fast and attentive.I would go back for lunch in the future.",92.91609

The inside was a bit on the rundown side, typical Chinatown restaurant. The decoration and atmosphere resembled most pho places. Everyone ordered pho, nothing complicated and pretty standard. If it was just based on food, this place would be average and not a bad place to grab some pho in Chinatown. But the service was terrible, if not the worse. One coworker found a piece of plastic in the soup, of course they stopped eating and waved down a waitress immediately to inform them. The waitress didn't seem to care and also tried to play it off as if it's a normal thing that could happen. Tried to explain how the plastic was probably used to wrap the beef, its clean and there's really nothing wrong with it being in the soup.

If you insist on coming here on the strength of the Momofoku brand, despite repeated warnings from your friends who live in the area that it is REALLY bad, then just go ahead and make a mental note of where you'd theoretically like to eat AFTER coming here so you can go there right after because if you have had a chance to sample other ramen places in Toronto then you will leave Momofoku disappointed and hungry. The shoyu pork belly ramen here is the worst in Toronto. It's seriously so low effort. It kinda tastes like Mami brand ramen in a packet if you let it sit for 3 days. We tried 3 different buns hoping that we would luck out on something that we actually liked. Tried the chilled shrimp, pork belly, and roast beef bun. All awful. Like the ramen, low in flavour and no effort on presentation whatsoever.  Check my pics. I'm still in disbelief that food this quality is being served in such a prime location.Oh and the desserts here are the most low-effort thing of all.

1970,Italian place,"After one failed attempt, we finally made it in to give Pai a try. The first time, it was lunchtime on a weekday and two sleeping toddlers in strollers. There was no ramp/elevator so we had to choose a different location if we wanted to have a peaceful lunch (which we did end up having elsewhere). We had tickets to the Royal Alexandra Theatre and thought that this would be the perfect time for a second attempt. As we passed by at 5:25pm, we noticed the line up already out the door. I ended up jumping out of the car while hubby went to look for parking. There's a line to get a buzzer and I was pleasantly surprised when I got to the host desk that it would only be a 15-20min wait. Although it looks small, the restaurant is actually quite large and can seat lots of people. We ended up eating about 20 minutes and was led to the back area. We passed a couple of ""traditional"" mat-on-floor type raised seating. The decor reminded me of a street food type setting. The menu is in Thai so I needed to read the translated explanations. When we were waiting I saw a bunch of mango sticky rices pass by so I knew I wanted to leave room for those. We bypassed the appies and got a Pad Thai (I wanted to compare with Royal Orchid and one in Grand Cayman which is so far the BEST tasting Pad Thai I've had), and a green curry with chicken served in a young coconut. We also got two iced teas. When I asked if they came pre-sweetened, I should've asked if the level of sweetness could be customized since other places typically make it too sweet for my liking. This one was just that. I'll have to ask next time around if we come back. We found that the wait was a bit long... over 15 minutes for the food to come out.  The Pad Thai was served with grated cabbage just like the Caymans so I was excited. The tamarind sauce was sweet, like Royal Orchid's but didn't have that savory flavour like the one in the Caymans (good thing we are going back! Can't wait!!!). So flavour was ok but the noodles were complete stuck together in a mass. Maybe too soft? Not enough oil?  I don't know. The green curry was nice and anything they couldn't fit into the coconut was served in a separate bowl. Mango sticky rice came nicely carved and on regular sticky rice. I've had ones served on purple sticky rice which gives it a nice texture. Flavour wise it was good but a bit skimpy on the mango. This dish was quite small for the $10 price tag.

We also got two iced teas. When I asked if they came pre-sweetened, I should've asked if the level of sweetness could be customized since other places typically make it too sweet for my liking. This one was just that. I'll have to ask next time around if we come back. We found that the wait was a bit long... over 15 minutes for the food to come out.  The Pad Thai was served with grated cabbage just like the Caymans so I was excited. The tamarind sauce was sweet, like Royal Orchid's but didn't have that savory flavour like the one in the Caymans (good thing we are going back! Can't wait!!!). So flavour was ok but the noodles were complete stuck together in a mass. Maybe too soft? Not enough oil?  I don't know. The green curry was nice and anything they couldn't fit into the coconut was served in a separate bowl. Mango sticky rice came nicely carved and on regular sticky rice. I've had ones served on purple sticky rice which gives it a nice texture. Flavour wise it was good but a bit skimpy on the mango. This dish was quite small for the $10 price tag.

I look forward to my next visit!",87.75287

2080,Italian place,"Ramen Isshin is hands down the best ramen I've had. Granted, I'm not generally a huge ramen fan. The idea of noodles and broth has never struck me as particularly exciting. I of course understand that there's a stark difference between chicken noodle soup and ramen - I mean more conceptually.Ramen Isshin has made me a convert. It delivers on the unique qualities of a great ramen  - rich, flavourful broth, succulent noodles, the right combination of garlic/salt/spice - but then elevates the whole experience with an inventiveness only a great and passionate chef could muster. I got the Red Dragon. Besides ticking all the box's I just mentioned, it also had this mild sweetness to it. I generally don't like much sweetness in a savoury dish, but this somehow pulled everything together really nicely, almost as thought the ingredients were naturally sweet. I doubt no sugar was added, but the point is that it worked. Really, really well. The pork itself was lovely. I'm not a big pork guy, but the flavour of the meat wasn't at all aggressive which I appreciated. The sprouts added an awesome crunch, along with the peanuts. Loved the chilli flake oil on top as well. The dish itself was also really beautifully presented. I wasn't starving going in, but got hungry the moment I was served.

Started with 2 bowls of MISO SHIRU (miso soup, $3.50) which was flavourful but a bit too heavy on the bonito for my taste.  The TAKOWASABI ($5.30) was cool-spicy-deliciousness: chopped tender octopus in biting wasabi served slightly chilled, a great starter or snack with drinks.  First hot dish was the KAKIMAYO ($9.30), baked oysters with spinach, mushrooms, garlic mayo and cheese. I think we found 4 tiny oysters total in the dish but it was still super delicious. They should really offer a vegetarian version with all mushrooms and no oyster at all.  Next we had the highly recommended BRIE CHEESE ($8.90). I was sceptical and happily proven wrong. Gooey warm brie deep fried in a crisp golden crust served over not-too-sweet mango and berry coulis. Wow. In retrospect, it's deep fried cheese... how can that go wrong?  Then came the meat. KARUBI ($9.9) a tiny plate of bland, sad-looking, cardboard-thin beef ribs served with a bowl of oil. We were expecting something salty-sweet & charred like Korean galbi, but alas thiskarubi dish was a disaster. After the first bite I declined to eat any more, it was so disappointing.Finally the TONTORO ($8.50) grilled pork cheek skewer. Worst pork cheek I've ever had. Tough and chewy. When is cheek meat ever chewy??   I can't even.To drink: OOLONG HIGH ($8.30) vodka & oolong tea over ice. Cool and refreshing in all the right ways and no sugar!!!

2170,Italian place,"Talk about quick service! We were in and out in a half hour (3 dishes, no drinks).The salmon oshizushi left much to be desired as it tasted quite... plain? I usually opt for sushi rolls with salmon sashimi on the side (when eating at sushi places, not here), so maybe I'm just not used to this concept. The temperature and mild flavour did nothing for me. I will not be ordering this again.Moving onto the good stuff, the kakimayo was so freaking good. I was a little worried as I'd never had oyster before, but after seeing all the cheese, I'm pretty sure this tastes nothing like the raw thing anyway. It was more like cheesy mushroom bake, placed into a pretty dish. I'm already looking forward to eating this again.The gyōza was also good. I was taken aback by how much the filling looked and tasted like meat, but the dish is labelled as vegetarian! The presentation was unfortunately a little lacking though - those gyōza deserved more than a small bed of lettuce underneath them.Overall, the place was a lot louder than I expected.

The restaurant also has a featured menu with different selections every month. I've been to both North York and the downtown locations, and I've never had a bad experience. The restaurant is very loud, as you walk in all the waiters and waitresses will greet you all at once. It's not a place to go if you are trying to talk a lot- The patio is much quieter as an alternative during the summer time. Tables are small, but doesn't change the experience. I don't have many places I go to frequently but I find myself coming back a lot because the food/drinks is great.

Server was friendly and introduced certain items and drinks. If you're going for the Kinkalicious event, it requires a minimum of two orders (29/person). It was a 7 course meal so here goes.....Sashimi sampler: My fav - lobster tail, salmon and scallop. Was nice, cold and fresh. Seaweed & tofu salad: Light and not too saucy. Fry plate (karage & takoyaki): didn't try the takoyaki, but karage was fried nicely and had a good crunchGrilled pork cheek skewers: A bit chewy for me, but the taste was decent. Baked oysters: Nice and cheesy! Had potatoes mixed in as well which complemented well. Mushroom & Cheese bibimbap: Was quite big considering the size of the other dishes, more toppings would have been nice.Matcha ice cream: nothing too special, but at least its a dessert! Service: expected the almost non stop shouting and enthusiasm, did not expect to be that rushed for time.

2310,Italian place,"I came here the other day for a quick bite and the weather wasn't very nice - very rainy in fact, but i stopped by for a quick coffee and some appetizers. They have two sections - one for dine-in, and one for grab and go. Becuase I wasn't staying long, I went to the grab and go section. I ordered a Cortado and their GRIDDLED FISH ""BANNACOS"" - recommended by the girl who was serving me at the counter :) it did not disappoint!The fish tacos were presented beautifully along with a apple cucumber salad :) the fish was nice and crispy, and the seasoning and garnishes with the taco was excellent! They used a bit more sour cream than i would like, but all in all the tacos were very tasty and i love the presentation of the apple cucumber salad on a lettuce leaf :) I was also surprised by the coffee! I didn't think it would be a place where i instantly would think great coffee, but they cortado was great! the expresso was done very well, lots of foam and I enjoyed my drink very much.

The restaurant did take them back and remade them completely.Overall the flavour was OK, but the portion for the pizza was huge.

The burger is accompanied by Taro chips, but I swapped them for fries, which were perfectly crispy.I'll start by saying that the meat they used for the burger was juicy and delicious. It's unfortunate that they hid the taste of the beef with 6 pieces of lettuce and a sauce that I couldn't figure out. Tip: take off the top bun and the lettuce and taste the beef on its own.

2350,Italian place,"I can get an appetizer, entree, and dessert here without breaking the bank. I wish I lived closer so I could have affordable meals everyday.Manpuku is a favourite among students since all their dishes are under $10. In fact, you could spend $10 here and leave very full. I usually order their curry udon which leaves me quite full despite what the price may suggest. It comes with soup, udon noodles, and their curry on top. I like to drink the soup first and then mix the udon noodles with the remaining curry so it doesn't wash out the curry flavour. It's a comfort meal that costs under $8, so if you like udon and curry, this is a must order!For appetizers, I normally get their tofu nuggets. They're brushed with a sweet and sour sauce and packed with edamame and carrots for an awesome change up in texture. If you're thinking of getting a dessert, I would definitely say go for it. I've had their tofu cheesecake and mango cheesecake - personally, I prefer the mango. There's no crust, unlike the tofu cheesecake, but the mango flavour comes through nicely. This comes in at $3.50 (I think).In total, our bill came to under $50 when 3 of us each ordered an app, entree, and dessert. Amazing deal and place! I'll be back soon.",78.26648

2390,Italian place,"Today was my first time going to this place. Before today, I have never heard of this place until a friend who went to the university across the street brought me there. The restaurant was small as it was tucked in a corner inside a food court. I noticed the menu only had donburi, udon, and some appetizers. We were seated quickly. The waitress were Japanese, so immediately I knew my udon would be more authentic compare to other Japanese udon place. We both ordered udon, with mine the Kitsune udon and hers the Kake udon. We also ordered some appetizers- takoyaki and yakionigiri (pan fried onigiri).The Kitsune udon didn't have much toppings, only a big piece of inari (sweet tofu skin), and two slices of Japanese fish cake. The portion of the udon was small, but the soup was tasty. The udon was cooked perfectly. However, the takoyaki... Well... let's just say I have had better ones. The ones at this restaurant were big, but don't get fooled by the look. It was 90% dough, 10% octopus. The yakionigiri... I don't know... It's salty on the outside, like they pan fried it with soy sauce. I personally not a fan of it. Overall, the food was not bad, but the price was CHEAP!! It's only around $5 for a bowl of udon. I will definitely recommend it if you are around the area and looking for CHEAP and TASTY Japanese udon.",81.21655

After taking our drink orders and giving us some time to review the menu, the server took our order and was attentive onto when we needed refills for drinks. I ordered the Bang-Bang Sour beer and then a Summer Smash (highly recommend if you like mojitos!)Now, the food. Man. The food was on a much higher level than I thought. I initially came in thinking this place would disappoint on the food, that it was all flash but no. I got the Feenie burger (throwbacks to Boy Meets World days) which was named after the chef and it was delicious. More than delicious. I want another one. Like, now. My wife had the modern bowl with glazed salmon and usually those kind of things suck but everything about that dish was perfectly balanced. The salmon was also tender and not dry.

2430,Italian place,"""oh my goodness... this is the best sangria ever!""What time we arrived/Wait time?I made a reservation at 2:45pm on a Tuesday so we we did not have a wait time nor was the restaurant too busy at that time. The restaurant filled up almost completely by the time we left which was around 4:30pm. I was recommended this place by a co-worker because it is her go-to spot. She told me that if I HAD to go to the rooftop patio or else there was no point in going! So I made to sure to call ahead and request a spot on the patio. They told me that they only take requests in case of weather complications. It also seems like Cactus Club is composed of 3 different restaurants - each being on a different floor!Atmosphere?I absolutely was blown away by the interior of the rooftop. It is so so beautiful and such a fun environment. The music wasn't too loud either. There were fun couch seats around the edge, but we did not get seated there (I think those are for bigger groups). There are sheer, white curtains that I believe you can close if you wanted more privacy... it made the place look more like a resort and added a poise vibe.Service/Staff?It seemed as if all the servers were women. They weren't the friendliest but everything was brought to us in a timely manner so I have no real complaints. Food/Menu?The menu is a simple two pager which I like because when there are too many options then it gets really confusing for me to choose. For drinks- we started with the ""rose sangria"" and a ""signature sangria"". They both had sprite in them which made them fizzy and the flavours were AMAZING! We said they both tasted similar to slushies but the signature sangria was much better so get the one for sure!!!I have tried SO many sangrias in my life and that one in particular was very high up there. For mains - she recommended the chicken creole and the poke bowl so we each got that. The poke bowl was very fresh with the mangoes and salmon, and the chicken creole with asparagus/mashed potatoes was really tasty and simple. It was the perfect portion. Overall we loved loved loved this place and would totally go back!Would be so much for a night out for a friends birthday or even for a nice lunch.",81.71625

It also seems like Cactus Club is composed of 3 different restaurants - each being on a different floor!Atmosphere?I absolutely was blown away by the interior of the rooftop. It is so so beautiful and such a fun environment. The music wasn't too loud either. There were fun couch seats around the edge, but we did not get seated there (I think those are for bigger groups). There are sheer, white curtains that I believe you can close if you wanted more privacy... it made the place look more like a resort and added a poise vibe.Service/Staff?It seemed as if all the servers were women. They weren't the friendliest but everything was brought to us in a timely manner so I have no real complaints. Food/Menu?The menu is a simple two pager which I like because when there are too many options then it gets really confusing for me to choose. For drinks- we started with the ""rose sangria"" and a ""signature sangria"". They both had sprite in them which made them fizzy and the flavours were AMAZING! We said they both tasted similar to slushies but the signature sangria was much better so get the one for sure!!!I have tried SO many sangrias in my life and that one in particular was very high up there. For mains - she recommended the chicken creole and the poke bowl so we each got that. The poke bowl was very fresh with the mangoes and salmon, and the chicken creole with asparagus/mashed potatoes was really tasty and simple. It was the perfect portion. Overall we loved loved loved this place and would totally go back!Would be so much for a night out for a friends birthday or even for a nice lunch.",86.14014
2440,Italian place,"Portions are super generous. My friend and I came here for a work lunch and shared the truffle fries. I got the grilled chicken modern bowl which came with Jasmine rice, salad, mango salsa, cous cous. My friend was craving the lettuce wraps since she had it two weeks ago at the Sherway Garden mall location. It was very delicious and very filling for an appetizer. If you were going to come in a group of 4 or more, the lettuce wraps appetizer alone will fill you up! Truffle fries were amazing as well, light truffle oil which I assumed were used and the dipping sauce which I believe was horseradish was a good side. We sat on the roof top level and they had the heaters on since it was cold out. Very nice and cozy. Overall, great atmosphere and good food!",81.71405

This was my first time trying, and I loved it! It was delicious. We also got a side of takoyaki, which was decent. It definitely was quite soggy and the flavour fell flat. Nothing like what you'd get in Osaka, but I obviously can't compare Canadian standards to authentic Japanese cuisine!I ordered the original pork ramen, as I've heard it's what Kinton is famous for. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed by the end result! The chashu, unlike what it should be, was literally pure fat. Although that may appeal to some people, I didn't find it to be the best companion to the meal. The broth was bone white, but for some reason, I found that it really did lack depth of flavour. It was fatty, for sure, but I've made ramen broth at home, and I really do think it was missing that collagen. I've had better broth at smaller ramen joints, and perhaps Kinton is just too large a franchise/business to really put as much effort into its broth anymore.Overall, it was okay, but would likely not return just for its ramen.",80.47695

Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed by the end result! The chashu, unlike what it should be, was literally pure fat. Although that may appeal to some people, I didn't find it to be the best companion to the meal. The broth was bone white, but for some reason, I found that it really did lack depth of flavour. It was fatty, for sure, but I've made ramen broth at home, and I really do think it was missing that collagen. I've had better broth at smaller ramen joints, and perhaps Kinton is just too large a franchise/business to really put as much effort into its broth anymore.Overall, it was okay, but would likely not return just for its ramen.",84.87516
2479,Pakistani restaurant,"This is a super belated review, as I came here last year at around Christmas time. I didn't have Yelp at that time, and only stumbled upon my photos now!Came here after visiting the Christmas market, and was very excited to slurp down some hot noodles and soup. We started off with some green tea, which was nicely packaged in mason jars (so hipster) - careful though, as they cost extra!We then ordered an appetizer of tako wasabi to share.
