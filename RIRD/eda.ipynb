      "We went to Gusto101 for a friend's birthday and I can see why Sophie Trudeau and Michelle Obama chilled there too. The ambiance was really nice at night with low lighting. The server we had was friendly and helpful. The food was just superb! We all got pasta and I got the Mafalde ai Funghi which was recommended to me by friend and I'm so glad I did. This may be the best pasta dish I've eat had - and I've never been the hugest fan of mushrooms! The portion size also exceeded my expectations and I ended up even packing it (and I eat a lot so...lol). Would highly recommend to anyone! Afterwards I kept getting the same dish delivered and once added tried their burger on a whim. Is everything on their menu just amazing?!! The burger was cooked to perfection and tasted so succulent and delicious. Can't wait to go back/order the dishes again!\n",
      "This restaurant is a nice place to drink and socialize, but not great to eat (more on this below). Outdoor patio is great but fills up fast so come early to get a table. The interior has a warehouse feel with concrete construction, high ceilings and large windows for a lot of light. The downside was the food... some of the dishes were great but some were very mediocre. My favorite dishes were the scallops and arugula salad. The octopus was overcooked and the texture/flavor was not great. Also the mushroom pasta was bland.Another con is that the food took FOREVER to arrive. It took so long that we actually had to leave almost as soon as the food arrived so were in a rush to finish our food. The waitress apologized for the delay but it made for a less than stellar dinner experience.\n",
      "I had a good time here!The restaurant is super cool and trendy, and the food is really good!I came here on a Friday night with a group of 5 people and we had a reservation for 6:30. It wasn't super busy but by the time we left it had really filled out and had a lineup out the door. The restaurant is dimly lit and has a really cool industrial look to it. We were sat upstairs and am told that the roof opens up in the warmer months to make a giant outdoor patio, I'd love to come back in the summer to check that out. Our server was pretty attentive, they were nice about giving us extra time to select drinks and food and we didn't feel rushed at all. A few times the food came to the table and was given to the wrong person but it wasn't a big deal. For the food, I ordered the kale salad, I liked it, I found it a bit salty with all the cheese, but I liked the pine nuts and currants for texture, it was also a very large salad, I think it could be easily shared as a side for two people. I ordered the cacio e pepe pasta which was really good. The noodles were cooked perfectly and I really liked the taste of the sauce and the pepper. It looked like a small portion but it ended up being quite rich and salty and I actually had a hard time finishing it. I'm not a fan of mushrooms but a few people had the mushroom mafalde pasta and enjoyed it, they also loved the mushroom bruschetta. Lastly, I tried a piece of the steak and it was good, cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned, it wasn't outstanding but definitely solid. I liked the sourdough bread too, although I think it was a bit pricey for bread, which is often free at other restaurants. I didn't order wine but it's $1 per ounce which is a great deal. Overall this is a really cool place and the menu is pretty extensive so I think everyone could find something suitable. Prices are not outrageous, I think they're appropriate for the food quality and portion. I would definitely come back to maybe try one of their specials, unfortunately lasagna was on special for a different day, and also to experience the open roof in the summer!\n",
      "amazing. simple. good food and vibe. Â trendy. check it out. 100% endorsement lots of good choices for those that want variety\n",
      "I loved the setting and layout of the restaurant! It's located in the heart of downtown.It was a sunny afternoon and we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. If you'd like to sit outside on the patio, I recommend making reservations and bringing sunglasses! Our waitress was kind and helpful when it came to asking for a dessert and candle for my boyfriend (not complimentary - you do have to pay for it). It was a success and he was definitely surprised! However, the service was quite slow for brunch and perhaps that was due to the busy hour. I wasn't too bothered by it, as were some people.I ordered a Berry bowl because I was feeling 'fruity', however I wasn't too happy with the overall taste of it. It was more on the sour side and I prefer sweet - plus the yogurt was actual warm rather than cold. I've never had warm yogurt served as part of a berry bowl. Don't get me wrong, I still ate it but it wasn't the best. Probably WOULDN'T recommend that order. Although, my boyfriend ordered the Gusto burger and he found it to be flavourful and well cooked, so based on how happy he was with his meal I'd recommend it too! Lastly, I had to top off our brunch date with a Sangria and I have no complaints about it. Tasted just perfect. Overall I'd say Gusto 101 is a nice spot to catch up with friends or have a one on one date. Bound to have a good time here!\n"
